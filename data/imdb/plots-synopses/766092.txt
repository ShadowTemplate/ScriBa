Timmy arrives in South Park as a new student. Although he is obviously intellectually disabled and is only capable of saying his name, none of the teachers recognize this fact and instead diagnose him as having ADD and give him Ritalin. As part of Timmy's treatment, he no longer has to do homework, so naturally all the other kids demand to be diagnosed with ADD and given Ritalin, too. Meanwhile, Timmy ends up creating a local controversy when he becomes front man for a garage rock band.
A handicapped boys' arrival in class leads to protest. Meanwhile, the boys are diagnosed with ADD and heavily medicated.
