The story of the high school students Mikako Nagamine and Noboru Terao. When the alien Tarsians attack, Mikako volunteers to be a pilot in the space force that will protect mankind. The lovers try to remain in contact using cellular telephone text messages, but as each battle takes Mikako further from the Earth, each message takes longer to arrive. Will their love stand the tests of time and distance?
A high school romance is split apart when one member of the couple enlists in the UN space army to fight aliens who attacked our Martian colony. We follow their lives through the text messages they send one another, though the delivery times increase from a a few minutes while she trains in orbit to over a eight years as her crew delves deeper into the universe searching for Earth's enemies.
"Voices Of A Distant Star" is a unique take on romantic relationship torn apart by duty and growing distance to each other. In this case it is the distance of light years, which separates a Mech-Pilot in outer space, from her lover on Earth. Only through SMS can they keep contact with each other and the further the girl travels into space with a fleet of spaceship looking for alien aggressors, the longer her messages take to reach him. Following Einstein's general Theory of Relativity she also ages slower in relationship to him, but the true love they have for each other only grows through the hope of reuniting and sharing their emotion to the fullest.
The love of Japanese high school students Mikako Nagamine and Noboru Tera is tested when Mikako is sent to fight aliens in a distant universe and voice mails to and from Earth become months to years in transmission.
