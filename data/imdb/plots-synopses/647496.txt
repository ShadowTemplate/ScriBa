The Devington school has a long history of educating the privileged members of society and many have gone on to illustrious careers, such as in the Diplomatic Service. The Talbot family in particular has a long association with the school with three generations having attended. When Daniel Talbot is killed during the St. Malley's Day race, the same day his elderly grandfather dies of natural causes, Barnaby and Troy investigate. They find ongoing feuds between the school and villagers, a conspiracy theorist who thinks the school is the center of criminal activity, students who are having drinking parties at the local pub and the ongoing affairs of the school's secretive Pudding Club. The discovery of a long-held school secret leads to the discovery of the murderer.
The village of Midsomer Parva is dominated by the imposing Devington School - as a seat of learning, Devington may be undistinguished in the great world, but it is socially well-connected and it has economic clout. When the College's Pudding Club sets off a murderous chain of events, ranks begin to close against Barnaby and Troy, and they need inside information to catch the killer. Is it someone from the local village who has a grudge against the school or is the killing motivated by activities at the school?
Barnaby investigates the murder of a boy during a traditional annual race at an exclusive private school but meets with resentment.
