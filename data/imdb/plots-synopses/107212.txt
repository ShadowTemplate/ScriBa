A group of childhood friends, now in their thirties, reunite at Camp Tamakwa. Only a few of the original campers show up, but they still have a good time reminiscing. The people share experiences and grow while at the camp. They are dismayed to discover that the camp's owner, Unca Lou, is going to close the camp down.
During the reunion, teen crushes are rekindled, creating friction among the friends who are now in adult relationships. They revert to the rivalries and mischief of their time spent at camp as youth, mostly in good nature. The camp director makes a confession about something he did that summer and also makes an announcement that would spell the end of Camp Manakwa. Nostalgia takes over and at the end the future of two campers is intertwined with that of the camp.
Seven friends reunite for a week-long reunion at a summer camp in Ontario they used to attend as children which is now threatened with being closed down.
