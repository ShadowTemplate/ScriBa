It's Valentine's Day again and Charlie Brown dreams the seemingly hopeless dream to receiving a valentine from anyone. All the while, the rest of the gang have their own trials whether it be Linus' struggle to get the biggest card he can for his beloved teacher, or Lucy trying to get some token from Schroeder while Snoopy and Woodstock are having fun spearing valentines on each other's nose.
The gang celebrate Valentine's Day while Charlie Brown hopes for at least one valentine for a change.
