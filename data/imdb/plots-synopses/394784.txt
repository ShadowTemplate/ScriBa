When Dave Cutler, the local postman, is found with his throat slit, Barnaby and Troy are on the case. Cutler it seems had slept with most of the woman in the village so between spurned lovers and irate husbands, there are any number of suspects. They are assisted by the local police in the form of the very attractive WPC Jay Nash, to whom Troy takes a instant liking. When a second and then a third murder takes place, the police realize they have a far more complex motive that simple jealousy.
Goodman's Land is a typical village with two public houses, the token OBE with manor house, bored spouses, gossip and friendly team matches of Aunt Sally at the pub and the weekly mobile "fish & chips" wagon. As the young community officer remarks, "Who could ask for more?" Dave Cutler, the randy, young postman, may have made one delivery too many; Dave is bludgeoned, nearly decapitated, during his route. The villagers think Dave had to be dispatched by an angry husband until the following day, when young housewife and tax preparer, Debbie Shortlands, is struck down by the same hand. A third victim, is killed by a different method; however, the murders do have one consistent "theme." Barnaby and Troy are joined in their usual investigations by community officer WPC Jay Nash, to whom Troy is very attracted. Barnaby's CID skills are matched only by his uncanny prowess at Aunt Sally as the story unfolds.
The near decapitation of the local postman, whose hyperactive libido also makes him the village lothario, leads to a series of grisly murders involving other promiscuous villagers.
