A futuristic research compound develops a new police tool called the Power Glove. Supposedly, it gives the wearer incredible powers by letting him tap into the 'unused 80%' of his mental potential. It turns out that the glove also enables the wearer to take over the minds of others, and one unbalanced police volunteer tries to use this to stage a coup. In the end, one of the three test cops is killed, another survives to stay on the force, and the rogue cop makes his escape. 20 years later, the dead officer's son gives away his identity by using his father's personal martial arts technique in a fighting competition, thus drawing the attention of both the remaining good and evil supercops. The kids and the old guys must then start getting ready for a multi-generational final battle of good vs. evil.
