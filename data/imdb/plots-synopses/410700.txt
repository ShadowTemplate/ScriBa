Bobbi Bocha, a cynical private eye who says all men cheat, narrates a story that opens in Houston with a blond purposely running over a man multiple times with her car and then cradling his head as he dies. Flash back six months to the too-exuberantly happy Harris family - Clara and David are orthodontists with a thriving practice, a big house, twin boys who love Dr. Seuss, and David's teen daughter Amy, home from college. David hires Lisa, a klutzy, teary, recently-divorced woman, as a receptionist, and an affair quickly blossoms. Clara hires Bocha. Meanwhile, Bocha pushes her own daughter, who's about to get married, to see the downside. An elephant's faithful.
Based on the real story of Clara Harris, the Houston, Texas dentist who made headlines in July 2002 when she killed her adulterous husband by repeatedly running over him with her car.
