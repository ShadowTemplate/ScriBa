Documentary that explores actor/director Clint Eastwood and his art by juxtaposing each major stage in his life with a corresponding stage in the thematic development of his work. Clint Eastwood tells his own story, from his childhood in Depression-era Northern California, to life in the stratosphere of fame and fortune. He's torn up the wild West, patrolled the mean streets of San Francisco, and even gone into outer space. Follow the on-screen and off-screen life of the Oscar-winning film icon in this retrospective PBS "American Masters" 2000 documentary filled with film clips, archival material and interviews. Clint's "Unforgiven" co-star Morgan Freeman narrates.
