Lenny Burroughs is a struggling auto mechanic who serves as part-time driver for local gangster Rick in order to earn enough to buy his own garage and pay for his upcoming marriage. Unbeknownst to Lenny, his assignment includes kidnapping Jimmy Berg, an important gang kingpin who has robbed rival criminal Trevor Morrison of over $7 million dollars and killed three of his men including the son of Morrison's partner. The plan is for Morrison to trade Berg back to his partner, Steve Wayne, in exchange for the return of his money, a million dollar indemnity, and a percentage of union municipal contracts which are very profitable for the politically savvy Wayne. However, something goes wrong. Rick contradicts Trevor's plans and seems to be following the agenda of an unknown third party by ordering Lenny to a side street instead of the agreed-upon location. When he leaves the van, he's immediately run down by Wayne's men, who execute him gangland style. Fearing he'll be killed too, Lenny grabs the gun and threatens to shoot Berg unless the hoods return to their vehicles. A grim stand-off occurs on the street and in a local deli as negotiations continue on the phone as Lenny finds he has no choice but to act in Trevor's interest.
A young man about to get married earns extra cash by driving a local mobster, but things go awry when the mobster is killed by a rival crime boss.
