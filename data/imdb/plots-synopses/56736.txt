In the suburbs of Rome, the translator Vittoria breaks her engagement with her boyfriend, the writer Ricardo, after a troubled night. Vittoria goes downtown to meet her mother, who is addicted to the stock market, and she meets the broker Piero on a day of crash. The materialist Piero and the absent Vittoria begin a monosyllabic relationship.
After an all night talk to discuss their relationship issues, Vittoria leaves the apartment of her long time fianc√©, Riccardo, for good, she telling him that she no longer loves him, but she can't really express her feelings, most specifically why, beyond that. Riccardo accepts the news but doesn't really like it. Upon a visit to her mother at the Stock Exchange in Rome, where she spends the better part of her days monitoring her stocks, Vittoria meets her mother's stockbroker, Piero, a young, driven man. They are attracted to each other physically, and Piero ends up pursuing her doggedly, most specifically after a disastrous day on the market. She, in turn, is too physically attracted to him, although she is slow to let him into her life, she initially pushing him away whenever he gets physically close. She eventually does let him into her life. During their burgeoning relationship, they tell each other one thing, however their actions may tell a slightly different story.
A young woman meets a vital young man, but their love affair is doomed because of the man's materialistic nature.
