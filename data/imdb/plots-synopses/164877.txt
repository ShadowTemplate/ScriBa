This comedic drama features two young couples, and another couple of old friends who reenter the two couples lives. The story takes place mostly in two apartments across the street from each other in Mexico City at the end of the millenium. Intellectual Carlos is not offering as much love as wife Ana needs. Tomas, a world-traveling friend of the couple reappears after many years abroad. Across the street, womanizing executive Miguel and suffering wife Andrea are joined by visiting friend Maria. The presence of guests Tomas and Maria triggers lust, rejection, infidelities, reconciliation and other consequences of suppressed love and marital relations, among the six friends-three guys and three girls.
In Mexico, the insecure writer Carlos and his mate, the photographer Ana, are in crisis of relationship, and lodge for a period in Carlos' apartment their common friend and ex-lover of Ana, Tomas, who was traveling around the world for the last years. On the building in the other side of the street, the unfaithful executive Miguel and his sterile wife and former model Andrea are having a troublesome life, and they lodge the former passion of Miguel, the zoologist Maria. After confusions and misunderstandings, the women move together to Miguel's flat, while the men stay together in Carlos' place, disclosing secrets and beginning a war of sexes, where some of them will be hurt.
