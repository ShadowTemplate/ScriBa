It is getting dark. John [Brian Deacon] and Harriet [Ally Faulkner] have not yet found a place to park their camper. They pass two mysterious women in the road and pull up beside a deserted castle where they intend to pass the night. For days they camp there, not knowing that during the days the two women, Fran [Marianne Morris] and Miriam [Anulka], lie asleep in the cemetery while at night they pick up men and take him to their castle. There, they feed them wine, have passionate sex, and then stab them to death while drinking their blood. The only exception is Ted [Murray Brown], who manages to survive for three nights in a row. One evening Ted escapes. He runs to the camper to enlist John and Harriet's help. When John goes to start the car, Fran and Miriam get him. When Harriet goes to check on John, the girls get her. Ted apparently gets away.
