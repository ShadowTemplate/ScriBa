Poor Sicilian fishers are exploited by fish wholesalers. One of the families is trying to escape them by being their own boss. But fate nobody helps them, and even fate is against them.
In 1947, in Sicily near Catania, the fishermen in Aci Trezza for generations have been exploited by the local middlemen. The young 'Ntoni Valastro rebels against the economical situation of his poor family. He convinces the Valastro to mortgage their simple house in the Fidania Bank in Catania to buy a fish boat of their own and never work again for the wholesalers. One stormy day, he decides to fish due to the necessity of repaying the debt to the bank.
In rural Sicily, the fishermen live at the mercy of the greedy wholesalers. One family risks everything to buy their own boat and operate independently.
