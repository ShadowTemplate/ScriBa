'Kyun! Ho Gaya Na' is a situational romantic comedy -- a simple story about love and life. Diya Malhotra is an idealistic, sensitive girl whose childhood was spent in the coffee plantation town of Coorg. Her father, who single-handedly raised Diva after his wife passed away, decides that Diva should travel to Mumbai to help his friend Raj Chauhan, a confirmed bachelor, run a small orphanage that he has in his home. Diva will stay at the home of the Khannas, who also are friends of her father. Diva then meets Arjun Khanna, a seemingly free-spirited, fun-loving, adventurous guy. The two soon realize, however, that they will be staying in the same house since the Khannas, her father's friends, are Arjun's parents. The friendship that develops between Diya and Arjun and their opposing views on love and marriage are at the heart of this film.
Diya Malhotra lives with her dad on a farmhouse. She is friendly with Arjun Khanna, but thinks he is something of a jerk. She goes to spend some time with Raj Chauhan at his orphanage, and finds that Arjun will also be spending some time there. Raj has an ulterior motive to invite both of them, as he plans to get them to fall in love, and hopefully get married. But this does not happen, and Raj invites Ishaan, who, after Diya's approval, readily agrees to marry Diya. The wedding date is set, and Arjun is heartbroken, as he finds that he really loves Diya, but realizes that it is now too late to declare his love.
A woman decides to marry her childhood friend, after getting her heart broken by her sweetheart.
