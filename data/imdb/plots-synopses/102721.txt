Black comedy about a blind man, Martin, who takes photographs as "proof" that the world really is as others describe it to him. The film explores his antagonistic relationships with Celia, who cleans and cooks for him and habitually rearranges the furniture in the house, and with Andy, a mate he thinks he can trust.
Anonymous states that Celia, in addition to other duties, "habitually rearranges the furniture in the house." What she really does is place furniture in Martin's way so that he may trip. This also shows how she can be cruel to him when he does not do what she wants.
The life of a blind photographer who is looked after by a housekeeper is disrupted by the arrival of an agreeable restaurant worker.
