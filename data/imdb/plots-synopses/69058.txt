When her grandmother goes away on a trip, 7-year-old Mimiko stays at home by herself in her small, friendly village, unafraid of burglars. When she arrives back home from the train station where she saw her grandmother off, she discovers she has a visitor-a baby panda. She quickly makes friends with the young panda and names it Pannie. She later meets Pannie's father, a large panda she calls Papanda. She dubs Pannie her son and Papanda her father, and the three become a happy family with their own big adventures.
