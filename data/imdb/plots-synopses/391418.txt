Back in August of 2003, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Michael "Flea" Balzary, and Chad Smith) played a show in Ireland at Slane Castle (This being their second show). It was filmed during their time playing to a sold out crowd and was around the era of the "By the Way" album. The songs are as follows:
1. Intro
2. By the Way
3. Scar Tissue
4. Around the World
5. Maybe
6. Universally Speaking
7. Parallel Universe
8. The Zephyr Song
9. Throw Away Your Television
10. Havana Affair
11. Otherside
12. Purple Stain
13. Don't Forget Me
14. Right on Time
15. Can't Stop
16. Venice Queen
17. Give It Away
18. Californication
19. Under the Bridge
20. The Power of Equality
Some interesting facts about a few of these songs are:
The song "Maybe" is a song by the Chantels and John covered this one while on stage. The intro to "Parallel Universe" was the intro to "Latest Disgrace" by Fugazi from the album "Red Medicine". "Havana Affair" is a Ramones cover they play and the intro to "Right on Time" is the intro from "London Calling", a song by The Clash off their 1979 "London Calling" album. Also, the song "Soul to Squeeze" wasn't featured on here even though it was played because John broke a string during that song.
This is another must watch for a fan of RHCP and any rock lovers anywhere.
