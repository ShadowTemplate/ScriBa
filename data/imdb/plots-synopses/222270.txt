When a businessman is assassinated on election eve, the assassin, Mohan Joshi is arrested on the spot, but manages to escape days later during the media coverage. He is accused of terrorism and the country is thrown into an uproar. Many die who had no connection with the rivalries of Joshi and his victim, in a corporate attempt to scare the survivors into believing that Joshi is part of a "foreign hand" of bullies. Joshi meets Ajay and Ria then tells them the truth behind the whole incident. It seems that Joshi's teenage daughter died because of a brutal rape by the man whom he would later slay. Revealing while "on camera" that this man and his partners have been destroying everything in pursuit of their goals, Joshi declares that he killed the man in revenge, almost without thinking. "If that is terrorism, I'm a terrorist", he concludes. Later, Joshi is put into prison and sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, the reporters lead a silent march, flying the national flag of India, to find Joshi and make the truth public. He is freed, and justice is secured.
Rival news-reporters, Ajay Bakshi (Shahrukh Khan), and Ria Bannerjee (Juhi Chawla) engage in a comic war to be the first to interview notorius M.K. Sharma (Bharat Kapoor), in which Ria succeeds. Then the two are thrust in a battle for their lives as they must decide whether to save an innocent terrorist (Paresh Rawal) from being hanged, or sacrifice their very lives themselves.
