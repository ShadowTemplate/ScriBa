By accident, the 12-year-old Preston is given a blank check and when he fills in $1,000,000 - he is able to get it! He is having fun spending the money, but the gangsters who owned it want it back...
12-year-old Preston Waters is tired of his pain-in-the-butt brothers and stingy parents. One day, a rich but convicted money launderer by the name of Quigley nearly kills him in a parking lot and gives him (by mistake) a blank check. So Preston boots up his computer, makes out the check for one million dollars cash money, comes up with the pseudonym of "Macintosh" and starts to spendin'. But Quigley wants his money back -- it was supposed to be cashed by another man with a blank check and handed back to Quigley. Can Preston keep up the facade? Will Quigley and his goons get their money back? And will Preston learn how valuable money really is?
Preston Waters is a 12 year old boy who is sick of his parents always teaching him the value of money. Little does he know, he is about to learn it. When a smart crook, Carl Quigley, nearly kills Preston by running over his bike, he mistakenly fills out a blank cheque, which Preston prints out for $1 Million. Preston convinces the bank manager to cash the cheque, and when Quigley's employee returns to collect the money for Quigley and finds that the bank manager has given it to a kid, Quigley sets out to track the kid down and get his money. Preston creates the pseudonym of 'Macintosh' to handle his finance, and the police get suspicious. Preston begins his spending, but later becomes aware that he must avoid Quigley who is on his back, and the police seperately attempt to work out the mystery behind 'Macintosh'. Will Preston be convinced that money is'nt everything.
