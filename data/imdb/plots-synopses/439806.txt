Live, intimate and raw, ERIC CLAPTON - SESSIONS FOR ROBERT J is Eric Clapton's tribute to blues legend Robert Johnson. The project was filmed during tour rehearsals in London and Dallas, and features a recording session at 508 Park Avenue, the Dallas warehouse where Johnson made some of his final recordings. Clapton performs classic Johnson songs including "Kind Hearted Woman," "Terraplane Blues," "Me and the Devil Blues" and "Love in Vain" and discusses Johnson's influence on his career. A final session, where Clapton performs Johnson material solo, was filmed in Santa Monica, California.
