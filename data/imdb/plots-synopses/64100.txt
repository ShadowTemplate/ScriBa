Documentary film-maker Bob Saunders and his wife Carol attend a group therapy session that serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of the film. Returning to their Los Angeles home, the newly "enlightened" couple chastise their closest friends, Ted and Alice, for not coming to grips with their true feelings. Bob insists that everyone "feel" rather than intellectualize their emotions, and Carol pronounces "that's beautiful" after anyone says anything even remotely personal. Ted and Alice humor their friends, but it is obvious that there is a good-natured sexual tension at work within the foursome.
Couples Bob & Carol Sanders and Ted & Alice Henderson are best friends. After attending a weekend self-help self-discovery session (Bob is planning on making a documentary film on the subject), Bob and Carol feel newly enlightened, and want their friends, Ted and Alice, to feel the same way. "Feel" is the operative word as they want people now to feel rather than think. The foursome each examine their feelings, and admittedly their thoughts toward their individual relationships with each other and the topic of sex when Bob admits to Carol that he had a meaningless sexual dalliance, which Carol later mentions to Ted and Alice. After pushing the sexual boundaries with others, the foursome decide they have one last boundary to cross truly to test what they consider their new enlightened state.
