Car Wash is about a close-knit group of employees who one day have all manner of strange visitors coming onto their forecourt, including Richard Pryor as a preaching 'wonder-man' who is loved by most but loathed by one, and a man who looks like a thief by the way he is holding his bottle, but it is really his urine sample as he is off to the hospital. T.C's love life takes a turn for the better and the songs keep coming.
A day in the life of the employees at a Los Angeles car wash. Not all of the employees are black, there's a Mexican American and a Native American also out on the line. The man with the pop bottle is not thought to be a thief, but a madman known as "the pop bottle bomber". The chase around the car wash with the pop bottle and the scene with the "mummy" in the car are two classic scenes. Richard Pryor as the money-hungry preacher "Daddy Rich" is losely based on a famous Los Angeles money-hungry preacher from the 1970's. One of the DJ's heard in the movie is J.J. Jackson who later went on to be one of the orginal MTV Vee-Jays in the early 1980's.
