Cadfael is sure the unlikely novice Meriet is hiding a secret, and when a missing bishop's envoy is found dead, Meriet takes the blame. Cadfael must discover who Meriet is protecting and who is the real murderer. Ellis Peters fans will find the character name changes confusing and not helpful to the story.
Brother Cadfael has two mysteries on his hands when a new novice arrives at Shrewsbury and a cleric vanishes in the forest. The novice, Meriet son of Leoric Ashby, is determined to take his vows as soon as possible and become a monk. Cadfael takes a liking to the young man but finds his claim to monastic devotion doubtful believing there are other reasons for his desire to join their Order. Meanwhile, Cadfael sets out to find information on a missing cleric, Peter Clemence, who is the favorite of a local Bishop but disappeared in the forest soon after spending the night with the Ashbys, distant cousins. To solve both mysteries, Cadfael will need to learn more about the various relationships in the Ashby family.
