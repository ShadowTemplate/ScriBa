Zatoichi arrives in a town where a gambling house is kidnapping its poor, debt-ridden patrons. A rival establishment moves to pay those debts and free the peasants, but this house's seemingly altruistic boss is actually laying the groundwork for a ruthless money-grabbing scheme. The sixteenth Zatoichi film is the first from its star's own Katsu Productions, and is one of the series' most daring.



When a local gambling house kidnaps some peasants because they failed to pay their debts, a rival gambling house pays their debts and sets them free. But it's really all just a plot to enlist Ichi's aid in eliminating the competition. Once that's been attended to, the master of the surviving house of chance grabs more and more power - and more cash from the hapless farmers. Even a blind man can see that justice must be done!
