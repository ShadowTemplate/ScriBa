This erotic horror film, set in 1905, tells the story of a thief who seeks refuge in a castle owned by two women, Eva (Brigitte Lahaie) and Elizabeth (Franca Mai). The women are seductive and teasing, but turn out to be part of a vampiric cult of blood-drinking aristocrats.


1905. April in Paris. All the fashionable Parisian ladies partake of the current cure for anemia by stopping at the abattoir [slaughterhouse] for their therapeutic glass of ox blood. Some ladies, however, have taken the cure to a higher level. Somewhere near Paris, Mark [Jean-Marie Lemaire] (a thief trying to escape from four other thieves who want the gold coins he is carrying to London) takes refuge in a castle currently inhabited by two lesbian chambermaids, Elisabeth [Franka Mai] and Eva [Brigitte Lahaie], who are awaiting the arrival of the marchioness and her servants. Elisabeth feels an immediate attraction to Mark but, while the gang of thieves lay outside the castle awaiting the chance to kill him, Mark is seduced by Eva, much to Elisabeth's chagrin. When the marchioness and her servants arrive, they hold a party in which Mark (the only male) is showered with attention. When midnight comes, however, everything changes. The women are revealed as "vampires" who want Mark's blood. Elisabeth helps Mark to escape, while the four servants sate their bloodlust on Eva. When Mark confesses to Elisabeth that he is also in love with her, Elisabeth changes her mind, decides that she never really loved Mark, and shoots him. It is Elisabeth and the marchioness who go into the sunrise together.
