When Max dies in an accident, he goes straight to hell. But the devil Barney makes him an offer: if he manages to get three innocent youths to sell him their souls in the next two months, he may stay on earth. Max accepts, and returns to earth, equipped with special powers. However his task is harder than expected, especially when 7 years old Tobi demands that he marry his mother.
When a frequent sinner named Max Devlin dies, he goes to hell, as all bad souls do. But this time, there is a special exception-Barney, the devil's right-hand man, makes Max a deal. If he can trick three good, innocent people out of their souls in two months, he can return to Earth. Max goes off with special powers to make his "clients'" dreams come true. Max manages to get all three suckers to sign contracts giving up their souls, but being around so many good people changes his ways. When he learns that Barney lied and intends to harvest all four souls for himself, Max risks eternal damnation and burns the contracts, freeing his charges. But all works out well in the end, and Max returns to earth a better man.
