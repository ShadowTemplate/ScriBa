The quest for the true personality of multi-talented cult artist and psycho-magician Alexandro Jodorowsky


Fascinating and challenging, Alexandro Jodorowsky is a multi-talented person : director of cult-movies (EL TOPO, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, SANTA SANGRE... ), founder of the « Panique » movement, performer of provocative happenings. mime artist, succesful comic strip writer (the INCAL, ALEPH TAU, THE WHITE LAMA...), animator of the « Mystical Cabaret », Tarot card master, launcher of the « psycho-magic »....
This is the quest of the multiple facets of Jodorowsky and includes views of those who have been closely connected to him (Fernando Arrabal, Peter Gabriel, Marcel Marceau, Jean « Moebius » Giraud, the martial arts master Jean-Pierre Vignau). They appear like mirrors in this quest and reveal that the only important search is for oneself.
The film, in its long version, ends with an unique experience : a live performance of a « psycho-magic » act.
