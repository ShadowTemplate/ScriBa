Mr. Freeze is living in the arctic with his cryogenically-frozen wife. When a submarine destroys her containment capsule, he has to find someone to "donate" a new heart for her. His search turns up one donor with the right blood type: Barbara (Batgirl) Gordon. Her kidnapping sends Batman and Robin on a hurried chase to free her in time.
Victor Fries, aka Mr. Freeze, has found a home - the Arctic Circle, where he can live as a normal man can live in the tropics, and where his wife Nora remains in cryogenic suspension pending Victor's discovery of a cure for the illness that will take her life should she be freed too soon. However, a submarine on a scientific expedition surfaces through the ice of Fries' cave home, destroying the area - and breeching the seals on Nora Fries' cryo-chamber. In desperation, Victor dons the frigid battlesuit of Mr. Freeze to find the one doctor who can save Nora's life, but the doctor needs an organ transplant to pull off the operation. He finds a donor with the right blood type - Barbara Gordon, whose relationship with Dick Grayson is becoming more serious. When Barbara is kidnapped, Grayson and Bruce Wayne don their famous crime fighter costumes to track down Barbara and Freeze, and along the way learn the full story of Nora Fries' desperate predicament.
When Mr. Freeze, desperate to save his dying wife, kidnaps Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) as an involuntary organ donor, Batman and Robin must find her before the operation can begin.
