The true story of a single mom who overcomes many of life's obstacles.


Dawn Anna-Townsend(Debra Winger) is a single and very loving mother of four children. She has just landed a high-school teaching job and has met a wonderful man named Bink(Alex Van) whom she later marries. But the strength and courage of Dawn and her family are put to the test when she is diagnosed with a rare but fatal brain disease. She undergoes a risky surgery to save her life, survives the procedure, and starts the very painful recovery process with the help of her husband and children. But then tragedy strikes this woman and her family once again on the day of April 20th, 1999, when a deadly shooting massacre at Columbine High School takes the life of Dawn's 17-year-old daughter, Lauren(Quinn Singer). Determined not to let her daughter's death be in vain, Dawn becomes a public speaker for school safety and gun violence by telling the story of Lauren's life and death.
