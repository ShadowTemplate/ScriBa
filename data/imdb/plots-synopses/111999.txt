In this quasi-mythological costume series, Hercules (in Greek Herakles), the noble bastard son of Zeus, hence hated to death by his step-mother Hera, doesn't live as an Olympian after accomplishing his Works and the Argonauts' journey, as classical myth has it, but relinquishes immortality and continues to fight both human and supernatural evil on earth, as a wanderer in and beyond Greece, usually accompanied by his human side-kick Iolaus and sometimes by dodgy Salmoneus. Countless are the challenges, either especially set up by Hera or just on his way, but he always triumphs against all odds, delivers otherwise often hopeless mortals and moves on to new adventures.
Hercules is the son of the King of the Gods, Zeus, and a mortal woman, Alcmene. Hera, the Queen of the Gods, is jealous and angry and kills our hero's family with a fireball. Almost letting his grief overtake him, Hercules starts out on a journey to destroy Hera but when his best friend, Iolaus, is captured by the She-Demon and killed because Hercules did not help, our hero rescues Iolaus and the town and kills the She-Demon. Together, Hercules and Iolaus set out to help people in any way they can, getting into all sorts of messes and fighting all sorts of mythical beasts and people and making all kinds of new friends.
Hercules, aided by his best friend Iolaus, goes on many adventures helping people and slaying mythical monsters using his half-god strength.
