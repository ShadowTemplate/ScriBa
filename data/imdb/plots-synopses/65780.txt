In December of 1969, four months after Woodstock, the Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane gave a free concert in Northern California, east of Oakland at Altamont Speedway. About 300,000 people came, and the organizers put Hell's Angels in charge of security around the stage. Armed with pool cues and knifes, Angels spent the concert beating up spectators, killing at least one. The film intercuts performances, violence, Grace Slick and Mick Jagger's attempts to cool things down, close-ups of young listeners (dancing, drugged, or suffering Angel shock), and a look at the Stones later as they watch concert footage and reflect on what happened.
The film documentary of the Rolling Stones first tour of the United States in three years. It begins with the Stones looking at rough cuts of the film and then looking at the events that lead up to one of the darkest days in the history of rock and roll.
A harrowing documentary of the Stones' 1969 tour, with much of the focus on the tragic concert at Altamont.
