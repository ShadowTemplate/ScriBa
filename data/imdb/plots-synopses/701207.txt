Sideshow Bob is released from prison, runs for mayor as a Republican, and defeats "Diamond" Joe Quimby in the election. But a "Deep-Throat"-type informant tells Bart and Lisa that he was fraudulently elected. It's up to them to find the evidence.
Sideshow Bob is released from prison and runs for Mayor of Springfield. When he wins the election, Bart and Lisa suspect foul play and are determined to expose Bob's corruption.


Politically-charged radio host Birch Barlow's opinionated show takes aim at numerous areas of 'concern' for the city of Springfield. One of those is the city's incompetent Mayor, Diamond Joe Quimby. Barlow fields calls from concerned citizens, one of whom is Sideshow Bob. Bob claims he was wrongfully imprisoned, and Barlow begins a campaign to free Bob. Taking flack from the citizens, Quimby grants Bob a pardon.
In the aftermath, a secret group (of which Barlow and Mr Burns are members) convene to choose a candidate to run against Quimby in the next election. Their choice becomes Sideshow Bob, who manages to win by a landslide.
One of Bob's first acts is to construct an expressway that will end up passing through the site of the Simpsons' house. Bart and Lisa seriously doubt that Bob could have been so widely embraced, and set out to find the truth. Their research soon brings them to the attention of Mr Smithers, who tells them to look for the name 'Edgar Newbauer,' which will help their cause.
The search turns up nothing in the local registry or phonebook, until they find Edgar's name on a tombstone in the cemetery. Apparently, Bob had names taken from dead persons (as well as the local pet cemetery) , which helped push him to win the election.
The scandal is taken to court, and by tricking Bob, the kids get him to confess to what he did. In the aftermath, the Simpsons home is saved, and Bob is returned to prison...albeit a minimum security prison.
