This highly detailed series recreated the adventures of Conan Doyle's Victorian detective in painstaking detail, sometimes to the extent of recreating the illustrations which accompanied the original story publication in "Strand" magazine during the late 19th century. Thirteen of the Holmes short stories were adapted in this series, which was followed by two sequels ("Return" and "Casebook") as well as several TV movie adaptations.
Together the intrepid detective and his faithful companion, Dr. Watson, solve the mysteries of copper beeches, a Greek interpreter, the Norwood builder, a resident patient, the red-headed league, and one final problem.
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate a scandal in Bohemia involving Irene Adler, chalk drawings of dancing men, the identity of a crooked man, a missing naval treaty, a solitary cyclist's mysterious follower, the dangers of a speckled band, and a blue carbuncle found in the crop of a goose.
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson solve the mysteries of copper beeches, a Greek interpreter, the Norwood builder, a resident patient, the red-headed league, and one final problem.
