In a land of living machines, two young ones are chosen to seek the legendary Mask of Light to reveal the savior of all the lands from the dark forces of the Makuta. During the course of their adventure, they will call on the heroes of their people, the great Toa. These Toa, masters of nature's forces such as Fire, Wind, Earth & Water, try to protect the chosen ones as they seek their destiny.
In the robotic Matoran tribe from the island of Mata Nui, which is protected by six powerful guardians known as the Toa. Two small Matorans--one a potentially heroic "herald" and the other a historian-witness called "chronicler"--find a sacred mask of light, suggesting the imminent of arrival of a seventh Toa. Identifying that mystery figure proves difficult, however, especially with the evil spirit of shadows, Makuta, attacking Matoran with serpentlike warriors called Rahkshi in a bid to possess the precious Mask of Light.
The island of Mata Nui must face one final threat from the evil Makuta: The Rahkshi. The only hope for the survival of the islanders rests with two Matoran villagers, who must find the seventh Toa and deliver him the Mask of Light.
