After a break-in at their house, a couple gets help from one of the cops that answered their call. He helps them install the security system, and begins dropping by on short notice and unofficial patrol, and spends a lot of time discussing the couple's problems with the wife. The husband begins wondering if they're getting too much help.
A young professional couple are befriended and looked after by one very kindly uniformed police officer, who at first merely answers a burglary call at their home, but in the course of time his ever-increasing attentions to them come to be more and more suspect in themselves.
