In this, the third film, it's the pets who do the talking. The Ubriacco's find themselves the owners of two dogs, Rocks, a street wise cross breed, and Daphne, a spoiled pedigree poodle. James has a new job, pilot to the sexy and lonely Samantha. Mollie's just lost hers and is stuck at home.
Mikey and Julie are now older and no longer dubbed in this, the third film of the series. Mollie and James are still together and raising the children on their own. Mollie is no longer working for the same firm, and James has landed a terrific job as a private pilot to a sexy business woman, Samantha, who is after James. Two new additions arrive in the family in the form of dogs, Rocks and Daphne. More tension forms with the arrival of the dogs, and it looks uncertain if Mollie and James will remain together.
