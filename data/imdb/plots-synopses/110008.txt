As the human city development encroaches on the raccoon population's forest and meadow habitat, the raccoons find themselves faced with the very real possibility of extinction. In response, the raccoons engage in a desperate struggle to stop the construction and preserve their home.
Tokyo needs space to expand and that means less and less room is available for nature. The Tanukis, a special kind of metamorphosing raccoon, suffer the consequences. There is nowhere to go and more and more territorial fights happen. The old Oroku understands something needs to happen. For once the Tanukis unite and decide on a five year plan. The goal: to sabotage the building projects and scare mankind away. But that isn't easy. To do so the Tanukis need to improve their metamorphic ability to transform into anything. Almost every Tanuki can do it, but it hardly isn't practiced anymore. While Oroku trains the Tanukis, Gonta, a fearsome warrior, isn't so happy. He is shocked by the amount of forest that is gone already and demands immediate action. He wants war.
A community of magical shape shifting raccoon dogs desperately struggle to prevent their forest home from being destroyed by urban development.
