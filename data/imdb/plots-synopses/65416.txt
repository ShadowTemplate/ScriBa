Dashing pilot Arun romances Vandana Tripathi, and both in love with each other, become very intimate, and as a result Vandana gets pregnant. Arun and Vandana have a quiet temple wedding ceremony, and Arun leaves to re-join his duties. Unfortunately, Arun is killed, and Vandana is unable to convince anyone of her marriage with him, and as such must re-locate to hide her shame. She gives birth to a baby boy, who she must place in an orphanage, and then adopt. Unfortunately for her, the boy, Suraj, is adopted by someone else. She manages to find out their whereabouts, and gets a job as a servant. When she is about to be molested by Shyam, a relative, Suraj witnesses this, and kills him. Vandana takes the blame for this killing and is sentenced to imprisonment, leaving her son and her life behind, for a crime she did not commit. When she returns everything has changed, and she is unable to locate the family where her son was.
Vandana and Arun fall in love the instant they meet. On a trip to a Shiv temple, they get married in an impromptu ceremony in front of God. A chance rainshower strands them at a remote hotel where Vandana gets pregnant. With their legal marriage just around the corner, they don't worry about the consequences of their actions, but unfortunately, Arun dies in a plane crash. Vandana chooses to have the child, Suraj, and as she promised to Arun, wants to raise him to be an Air Force pilot. Fate is cruel to Vandana, however, and the child is adopted by a wealthy family. Vandana becomes a nursemaid to stay close to Suraj. A family member tries to molest her, and in the ensuing fight, Suraj comes to protect her and kills the perpetrator. Vandana chooses a jail sentence to save Suraj, but in the course of her sentence, loses the family--and with it: Suraj. Now what will Vandana do? To find out, watch Aradhana.
