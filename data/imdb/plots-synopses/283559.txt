On their way back from a conference, two medical school friends bump into a college cheerleaders contest in Oregon. Party animal Patrick Fisher insists on going until his buddy concedes to 'one beer', but dutiful Steve Hillman is the one who gets seduced by local Amber. Alas it's a trap; he gets robbed and her lover, Bo Cooper, beats him up and abuses him. Disgusted with himself Bo shoots himself - his father is the local sheriff. He has a terrible corrupt hold over the town and sets the boys up as wanted 'killers'. Only Steve's girlfriend and local paranoid civil rights-obsessed loner Olie Parks will still help them to contact the already suspicious FBI.
