The crew of a nuclear bomber attack the Soviet Union while the President of the United States tries desperately to regain control of his military after his helicopter crashes during a limited nuclear exchange in this film with a scenario similar to A prova di errore (1964) and Il Dottor Stranamore (1964). Originally a made for cable movie, it concentrates on the relationship between a veteran pilot and his female co-pilot and the president's attempt to wrest control away from a war-mongering successor.
This is an awesome movie, The President of the United States and the Air force General played by James Earl Jones is an absolute best portrayal of what might happen if this scenario would be played out in a real life situation. We enjoyed this movie and would love to own it This is a classic that should in all honesty go down in history as one of the best made movies of it's kind.
