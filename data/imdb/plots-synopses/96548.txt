It is 1917, and lunatic General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett is leading the British troops at the front lines against the Germans, while everyone waits for Field Marshall Haig's big push. There are various emotions throughout the camp about it. For Captain Kevin Darling, Melchett's bull-dog-like right-hand man, it makes no difference, as it appears he will be safe and sound with the general when the big push occurs. For Lieutenant George Colhurst Saint Barleigh, he is overly excited at thrashing the Germans. For Private S. (probably for Sod-Off) Baldrick, it's a terrifying experience he is not looking forward to. For Captain Edmund Blackadder, however, it's something he's too cowardly too face. Self-centered, arrogant, and sarcastic, Blackadder is always constantly searching for a way out of this silly war, and will try various, often crazy, variations on escape, all of which will take a turn he never expected. Sharing a dugout with George and Baldrick, his main obstacle for escape is Darling, who will ensure everyone is present for the big push.
In this series, Captain Edmond Blackadder is an intelligent, self-centered officer in the trenches of World War I, whose aim is to survive til the war is over. He is assisted by the eager but stupid Lt. George Colthurst and the moronic, grungy Private Baldrick. Blackadder's commander is the insane General Melchert, who is assisted by Blackadder's rival Captain Darling.
Stuck in the middle of World War I, Captain Edmund Blackadder does his best to escape the banality of the war.
