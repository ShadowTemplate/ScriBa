Abbot Radulfus brings a hard-nosed new priest for the parish, who (among other acts) refuses absolution to a pregnant girl who is then found dead. He quickly becomes so hated that no one is too sorry to see him dead. But Cadfael must not only identify his killer, but determine whether the girl was a condemned suicide or innocent murder victim -- and his findings may keep the girl's body out of holy ground.
When Abbott Radulfus changes allegiance to the pretender, King Stephen, during the midst of civil war, he consents to the appointment of Father Ailnoth as the new parish priest for Shrewsbury. Ailnoth is materialistic, implacable, and overly puritanical and soon alienates everyone in the shire. When Cadfael refers a pregnant young girl to the new priest for absolution, the unforgiving confessor dismisses her as a whore and orders her out of the church. When the distraught girl is found drowned in the mill pond, an apparent suicide, the peasants rise up against Ailnoth, who is rescued by the Abbey's monks. Cadfael finds what he thinks may be signs of violence on her body and suspects foul play. When Ailnoth's lifeless body is found entangled in the mill wheel, he knows that there is a murderer in Shrewsbury.
An unpopular Puritanical priest new to Shrewsbury refuses to give a pregnant young girl absolution resulting in her apparent suicide.
