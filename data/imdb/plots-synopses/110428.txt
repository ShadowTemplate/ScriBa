A meditation on power and the metaphor of the body of state, based on the real episode of dementia experienced by George III [now suspected a victim of porphyria, a blood disorder]. As he loses his senses, he becomes both more alive and more politically marginalized; neither effect desirable to his lieutenants, who jimmy the rules to avoid a challenge to regal authority, raising the question of who is really in charge.
The story of King George III of England's slide into insanity, and the political and royal back stabbing which results from his incapacitation. Despite being very amusing at times, this is a sad tale of medical practices in the later 1700s as well as an insight into life inside and around the royaly of the time.
