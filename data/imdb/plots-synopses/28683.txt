1847 - In the gay half-world of Paris, the gentlemen of the day met the girls of the moment at certain theatre, balls and gambling clubs where the code was discretion ... but the game was romance. This is the story of one of those pretty creatures who lived on the quicksands of popularity - Marguerite Gautier, who brightened her wit with champagne, and sometimes her eyes with tears. From the novel of Alexandre Dumas fils this is the story which Giuseppe Verdi took for La Traviata.
A Parisian courtesan must choose between the young man who loves her and the callous baron who wants her, even as her own health begins to fail.
