J.W. Katadreuffe is the son of Joba Katadreuffe and A.B. Drevenhaven. Though fully neglected by Joba, Dreverhaven ensures the succesfull career of his son. Mostly unseen, though he sues his son a few times. The son Katadreuffe succeeds, but at great costs.
The police detain Jacob, a young lawyer, following a death. He tells his story in flashbacks. His parents are stubborn: his mother, whose name he takes, is mute with him and rejects offers of marriage from his father, Dreverhaven, a stern and imposing bailiff. Dreverhaven, for his part, will not acknowledge Jacob in public, save for legal ploys to keep Jacob impoverished. Jacob, first a debt-ridden office boy, rises through intelligence, hard work, and single-mindedness to become a lawyer. His success is tempered by his mother's silence, his misjudgment of a young woman's feelings, and his father's cold, fierce aggression. Is his father merely building Jacob's character?
A ruthless court bailiff is found dead, and a young lawyer is the prime suspect. Told in a series of flashbacks, Jacob Katadreuffe tells the tale leading to the events of his final confrontation with bailiff Dreverhaven. What unfolds is the man's life story ... of his strained relationship with his mother, of his strong desire to make a better life for himself (largely self-taught), of his obsession with his father, and the bizarre battle of wills with Dreverhaven.
Jacob Katadreuffe lives mute with his mother, has no contact with his father who only works against him and wants to become a lawyer, at all costs.
