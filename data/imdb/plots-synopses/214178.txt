For generations the Sooryavansh family has ruled the communities and it's people justly and fairly. This generation is headed by Thakur Bhanupratap Singh (Amitabh Bachchan). He has 3 sons, the youngest, Heera (also Amitabh) he considers to be the black sheep, and most illiterate of the family, and he will not have anything to do with him. He is enraged when Heera proposes to marry his ward, Gauri (Rachana Bannerjee); and even more angered when Heera flip-flops, albeit at the request of Gauri, and refuses to marry her. Heera is shunned by one and all in the family, including Gauri. And then Radha (Soundarya) enters his life; she marries him; encourages him to live independently; and helps his business flourish. Soon they are blessed with birth of a son. Heera fulfills his father's dream of a charitable hospital for the poor. Bhanupratap comes to know of his grandchild, and meets him secretly. Then one day Bhanupratap is rushed to hospital, apparently poisoned by drinking kheer prepared by Heera, and Heera becomes the prime suspect of what may well become the death of his father.
