Together, they start an investigation into the murder of several crimelords and become convinced that Moriarty is alive and behind a plot to organize drug dealing. Given that Moriarty is supposedly dead, Holmes finds it hard to convince Inspector Lestrade. Holmes investigation leads him to a beautiful prostitute, who posed as a rich woman to lure Holmes into the plot.
