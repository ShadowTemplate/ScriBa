A British army officer who resigns his commission on the eve of his unit's embarkation to a mission against Egyptian rebels seeks to redeem his cowardice by secretly aiding his former comrades disguised as an Arab. When his unit is overwhelmed and captured by the rebels, the hero finds an opportunity to return the 'feathers' of cowardice sent to him by his former comrades by freeing them.

At the same time however, his Regiment is ordered to Egypt and the Sudan, and he soon receives three white feathers from his fellow officers. The white feathers accuse him of being a coward and he takes his fiancée's reaction to the situation be a fourth feather. Now alone in the world, he sets off for Egypt and the Sudan to prove his bravery and return the white feathers to those who sent them.
