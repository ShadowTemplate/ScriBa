An executive mortgages all he owns to stage a coup and gain control of the National Shoe Company, with the intent of keeping the company out of the hands of incompetent and greedy executives. He needs the same money, though, to pay the ransom that will possibly save a child's life. His resolution of that dilemma -- the certain loss of the company vs. the probable loss of the child -- makes for one distinct drama, and an ensuing elaborate police procedure makes for a second.
At a crucial point in his business life, executive Gondo learns that his son has been kidnapped and that the ransom demanded is near the amount Gondo has raised for a critical business deal. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom - that is, until he learns that the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted not Gondo's son, but the child of Gondo's chauffeur. Now Gondo must decide whether the other man's child is equally worth saving.
An executive of a shoe company becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped and held for ransom.



Caught in a corporate war with other executives in his company, National Shoe, Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) mortgages all he has and decides to purchase a majority of the stock to gain control and maintain quality of the product. As he begins to finalize the deal he is contacted by a kidnapper who claims to have his son, so he makes immediate plans to cancel his takeover and send the money as ransom. When he realizes that the kidnappers have taken the son of his chauffeur, Gondo changes his mind realizing that paying the money would bankrupt him. Police Inspector Tokura (Tatsuya Nakadai) and others convince Gondo to pay the ransom and that the money will be recovered in order for him to continue his business deal. As the money is paid and the boy returned, the police begin a thorough investigation that leads them to dead drug addicts and various underworld criminals in their search for the kidnapper.
