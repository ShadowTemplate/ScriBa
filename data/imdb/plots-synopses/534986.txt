Ambitious Prior Robert and self-serving novice Brother Columbanus instigate a trip to Wales to bring Saint Winifred's bones back to the abbey. Welsh Brother Cadfael is co-opted as translator. When a local bigwig opposes letting their saint leave and winds up dead, Cadfael must both prove the innocence of a foreigner and determine whether the little Welsh girl wants her bones left in peace.
Cadfael and several of his fellow monks from their monastery in Shrewsbury travel to Wales to reclaim the remains of St. Winifred whose bones are untended in her current burial site. They are not well received and the local leader, Lord Ryshart, swears to protect their saint's bones to the death. When Lord Ryshart is found dead, it's left to Cadfael to sort it all out. Although the death was set up to make it appear that the killer was Godwin, who has been wooing the Lord's daughter Sioned, the monks soon fall under suspicion. Cadfael will not dismiss out of hand the possibility that one of his fellow monks was responsible. When Cadfael learns of the killer's identity, he also devises a clever plan that will satisfy everyone.
Cadfael and a deputation of monks from Shrewsbury are dispatched to Wales to recover the remains of martyred St. Winifred over the objections of the local lord and residents.
