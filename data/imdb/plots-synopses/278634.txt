While accompanying his friend Hastings to a dig in Iraq, Hercule Poirot becomes involved in the murder of an archaeologist's wife. The victim, Mrs. Leidner, had been receiving threatening letters signed by her first husband, who was known to have been killed in a train wreck. Did he survive? Was it his younger brother who was avenging his memory? Did Miss Johnson get rid of her rival for her employer's affections? Did Richard Carey kill the woman he publically announces that he hates? Is the French priest really who he pretends to be? And how many deaths will occur before Poirot unmasks the murderer?
Hercule Poirot finds himself reunited with his old friend Captain Hastings who is participating in an archaeological dig not far from Baghdad. Soon after his arrival, Poirot hears a strange tale form Mrs. Leidner who is married to the archaeologist in charge of the site. She has been receiving threatening letters supposedly written by her husband who was killed many years ago. She can make no sense of it but when she is killed, there is every reason to believe that the letters and her death are connected. There is a wide selection of possible perpetrators but as Poirot sifts through the evidence, there is only one possible solution to the crime.
While Poirot is on holiday in Iraq, the wife of the head scientist at an archaeological dig confides to him that she is the target of threatening letters.
