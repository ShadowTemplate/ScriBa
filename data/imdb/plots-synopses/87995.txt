Frustrated punk rocker Otto quits his supermarket job after slugging a co-worker, and is later dumped by his girlfriend at a party. Wandering the streets in frustration, he is recruited in the repossession of a car by a repo agent. After discovering his parents have donated his college fund to a televangelist, he joins the repossession agency (Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation) as an apprentice "repo man". During his training, he is introduced into the mercenary and paranoid world of the drivers, befriended by a UFO conspiracy theorist, confronted by rival repo agents, discovers some of his one-time friends have turned to a life of crime, is lectured to near cosmic unconsciousness by the repo agency grounds worker, and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue concerning a huge repossession bounty on a 1964 Chevy Malibu driven by a lunatic government scientist, with Top Secret cargo in the trunk.
Otto is working at the grocery when he loses his temper and quits. Befriended by a Repo Man, Otto sees vehicle repossession as a kind of modern buckaneering. He is attracted by the adventure and the 'who gives a damn' attitude of the other Repo men. At the same time a package is taken from a government lab that has strange effects on anyone who sees it. It is hidden in a car which the government lists for reposession with a hefty reward.
Now-classic punk fable of Otto, the newly hired repossession man. Off beat film has a little of everything: action, comedy, urban decay, police drama, mystery, governmental conspiracy and even UFO's. Story centers on Otto's search for a mysterious Malibu carrying an odd cargo.
Young punk Otto becomes a repo man after helping to steal a car, and stumbles into a world of wackiness as a result.


Otto (Emilio Estavez) is a wound-up punker in suburban Los Angeles. He suffers a number of misfortunes early in the film, losing his job and girlfriend, and finding out that his stoner parents have given his entire college fund to a televangelist.
He is approached by car repossessor Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), who needs a vehicle driven out of a "bad area." Otto does him this favor, and is soon hired by the "Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation" as a repo man himself. Otto finds the life exciting, with considerable drug use and real-life car chases. After a short while, he finds himself bonding with the older repo men, and the good pay is a perk as well.
Soon every repo man in town is on the trail of an old Chevy Malibu, driven by a weird scientist guy. There's something very odd in the trunk, possibly dead aliens. Bud and Otto almost get the vehicle and the $20,000 bounty, but are intercepted by FBI Agent Rogerz (Susan Barnes) and her team. In a strange conclusion, it turns out the glowing Malibu can fly!
