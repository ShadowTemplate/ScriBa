Devout, wild west farmer, Clark Davis, works his tail off to provide for his wife, sons Aaron and Arnie, and daughter Missie. When his doted upon, equally devoted oldest son Aaron is startled, Clark, who was chopping firewood, accidentally hits his leg with an ax. He would have bled to death if wandering youngster Nate hadn't found them, brought them home and taken care of the farm, way above the kids' ability. Grateful Clark offers Nate an indefinite farmhand job, all the more interesting as Missy and he take to each other, but she's also courted by classy railroad surveyor. Once recovered, Clark realizes Nate is really Willie, the son of local grump, Zeke, who left years ago after his kid brother Mattie's tragical death. Decision time arrives for both families.


In this Janette Oke sequel to "Love Comes Softly," the eldest child in an 1800s frontier family, Missie Davis is a bright and beautiful elementary schoolteacher whose love for the prairie is matched only by her passion for books. When Missie encounters Grant, a handsome New England railroad executive, she feels as though shes met a hero from one of her novels. But their courtship is complicated by the appearance of Nate, a mysterious young man who helps Missies family in a time of need. Torn between two worlds, Missie finds herself at a crossroads, forced to choose between the love of two very different men and two very different futures.
