A no account outlaw establishes his own particular brand of law and order and builds a town on the edges of civilization in this farcical western. With the aid of an old law text and unpredictable notions Roy Bean distinguishes between lawbreakers and lawgivers by way of his pistols.
Roy Bean is nearly killed by the inhabitants of a badlands bar and brothel. He returns to take vengeance only to find that he is the new symbol of law and order in the area. He becomes the Judge and dispenses justice until time and events pass him by.
