When she herself becomes a target and suddenly disappears, the case attracts a colleague from the nationally syndicated television show "American Crime" as well. Together with Jessie's camera-man and later joined by her producer he tries to solve the mysterious case.
The crew of a television of a small town composed of the reporter Jesse St. Claire, her lesbian supervisor Jane Berger and the intern cameraman Rob Latrobe are investigating the disappearance of the stripper Diana Cox.
