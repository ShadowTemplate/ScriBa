Denise Richards plays Lauren, a divorced wedding-planner who falls for the groom-to-be (Dean Cain).


By all accounts, Lauren (Denise Richards) is professional to the hilt; as a wedding planner, she understands that there are few days more important to a bride -- or groom, for that matter -- than the day of the nuptials. When she meets Nick (Dean Cain), however, all her expertise and work ethics fall out the window. That's because she's fallen in love with him, but he's apparently already betrothed to someone else. Or is he?
