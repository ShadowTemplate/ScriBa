Belle's Magical World comes to life in three charming fantasy adventures presented like chapters in a storybook. In The Perfect Word, a silly misunderstanding between Belle and the Beast leads to a lesson in forgiveness. Then, in Fifi's Folly, a romantic evening for Lumiere and Fifi snowballs into a thrilling plunge down the mountain in a runaway sleigh. In Broken Wing, Belle urges the Beast to free a tiny songbird as an act of kindness. Enriched with gentle lessons and two original songs that seamlessly fold one tale into the next.
A Continuance to Beauty and the Beast, suitably teaches children to forgive, love, and be kind to one another.
