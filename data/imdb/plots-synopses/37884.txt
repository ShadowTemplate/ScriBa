Don Birnam, long-time alcoholic, has been "on the wagon" for ten days and seems to be over the worst; but his craving has just become more insidious. Evading a country weekend planned by his brother Wick and girlfriend Helen, he begins a four-day bender. In flashbacks we see past events, all gone wrong because of the bottle. But this bout looks like being his last...one way or the other.
An alcoholic spends a weekend alone with only his bottle for company. Don Burnam is a less than successful writer who shares an apartment with his brother Wick. He quit college midway through after selling a story to a major magazine but found that success would elude him. He turned to drink and now finds himself going on regular binges. He's supposed to go away with Wick for the weekend but having found $10 meant for their cleaning lady, soon finds himself at the local liquor store and his favorite bar. He reminisces with the bartender and anyone who will listen about his life and particularly about Helen St. James who he met at the opera and who loves him dearly, despite his illness. His weekend binge gets him into the drunk ward at the hospital and once home, contemplates suicide.
