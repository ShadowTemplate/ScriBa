They learn that he had met a nun, Sister Hilaria and her two wards Yves and Ermina Hugonin, on the road and accompanied them to their destination, the manor of Robert Botteril, who Ermina is to marry. The bandits attacked in the night however with Oswin and Sister Hilaria being separated from the children.
