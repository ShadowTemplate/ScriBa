When a painting owned by one of her clients is stolen from a Barcelona museum, a New York-based artexpert is sent there to help investigate. After more paintings are stolen, she learns that she is being framed for the crimes. With the help of her estranged husband, a New York cop, they must not only solve the crimes but clear her name.


A criminal case leads a cop into both love and danger in this direct-to-video action drama. When a very valuable painting is stolen in a daring robbery of a Spanish gallery, New York-based art expert Sandra Walker (Ellen Pompeo) is called in to help track down the thieves. Sandra is a single mother following her divorce from Bruce (William Baldwin), an NYPD detective, and Sandra persuades Bruce to look after their daughter while she's away. As the case drags on, Bruce begins to have his doubts about Sandra's well being, especially after he learns that she's working side by side with fellow art authority Daniel (Abel Folk), who was once his rival for her affections. When several people connected to the case turn up dead, Bruce flies to Spain to look after Sandra and help with the investigation, but its not long before he finds himself involved in more danger than he ever suspected.
