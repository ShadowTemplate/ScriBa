Rick Carlson, who is in his 30s, works as an L.A. County lifeguard, until a few events might forever change his life. In this pre-Baywatch movie, he deals with a 17-year old female, a new L.A. area resident, and an old high school buddy who is a Porsche dealer. Along the way, he attends his 15 year high school reunion, and falls for his ex-high school sweetheart, now a divorced mother. He has to choose whether to change careers, either as a Porsche dealer, or remain as a lifeguard.
