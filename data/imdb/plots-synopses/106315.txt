II can only think of four ski movies I've ever seen and I enjoyed them all. This one is no exception. It's a splendid story with adventurous buddies heading west, awesome mountain scenery with out-of-bounds skiing, a perplexing romantic triangle, deadly drug dealing in Aspen, and tragedy on the way to a happy ending.
The acting is excellent all around. For me Finola Hughes is irresistible as Bryce Kellogg who creates a real sex vs true love dilemma for the likable hero T J Burke played by Paul Gross. I knew I should have been a ski bum.
We need more movies like this one. There are many scenic ski resort areas in the US to shoot them in, often with nearby cities such as Seattle, Reno, Denver, and Boston for the addition of plot complexities and urban scenic grandeur..
