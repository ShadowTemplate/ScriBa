Jack McKee and Cecil Colson are bumbling drifters who make a living by rustling cattle in the wilds of Montana. Jack left his wealthy parents because he resented their posh lives. Cecil is of Caucasian and Native American descent seeking his own path in life away from his father. Both hustle and rustle their way in the world by targeting cattle owned by wealthy ranch-owner John Brown. Frustrated that someone is killing his cattle, John hires a pair of ranch hands, Burt and Curt, to find the rustlers. When Brown realizes he cannot trust his two inept ranch hands, he turns to the grizzled former rustler Henry Beige to find the cattle thieves. Jack and Cecil always stay a step ahead of their pursuers, not realizing that their luck must run out sometime.
Two drifters, of widely varying backgrounds, rustle cattle and try to avoid being caught in contemporary Montana.


True romantics seek the Wild West in Montana. With a pickup truck and an antique buffalo rifle, Jack (Jeff Bridges) and Cecil (Sam Waterston) rustle their way into the hearts of the native Montanans, who seem to have a bit of a grudge going against the New West, Nouveau Riche ranch owner (Clifton James). This is one of Slim Pickens best supporting roles and the rest of the cast is great as well and when you hear some of the funniest lines ever uttered on film you'll want your own copy of this film! My VHS copy is starting to show its age. Jimmy Buffett is in this film, and even though it's the same song he did in the film "FM" a few years later, this is the version I like. Get it on vinyl if you can find the soundtrack. When the DVD shows up, it's going between Thunderbolt and Lightfoot and Starman
