After a bomb destroys a railway carriage, the four survivors repair to the villa of one, Mrs. Delahunty, a writer of romance novels, a woman with a past. The others are an aging British general, a young German man, and Aimee, an American girl orphaned in the blast. As these four strangers recover in Umbria's countryside and become friends, Aimee's uncle, a cold and childless academic who studies red carpenter ants, arrives to fetch her. Mrs. Delahunty fears this may not be in Aimee's best interests, begins to drink heavily, and fails in her attempts to connect with Aimee's uncle. Meanwhile, a persistent detective investigates the blast.
After a train is bombed, a kindly Englishwoman (Maggie Smith) invites several of the recovering survivors back to her Italian villa. One of the survivors is a young American girl (Emmy Clarke) whose mother was killed in the wreck. Initially traumatized to the point of not speaking, the child, Aimee, responds to the older woman's kindness. The child's interest in life is slowly rekindled. Authorities seek relatives who might take the child and finds an uncle (Chris Cooper), who is not known to the child. An unkind and seemingly unfeeling man, he and his wife are childless professionals studying carpenter ants. The couple are obviously willing to take the child, but equally obvious is that they are doing it as an obligation. The uncle and the Englishwoman struggle to find common grounds as he contemplates returning to America with the child.
An unlikely group of people find solace and friendship after being thrown together in the wake of a terrorist attack.
