At the beginning of the twentieth century, Mrs. Edwin Muir - Lucy - widowed for one year, decides to move out of her controlling in-law's home in London to the English seaside with her adolescent daughter Anna and their long devoted maid Martha. Despite the rental agent trying to dissuade her, Lucy decides to rent Gull Cottage at Whitecliff-by-the-Sea. She learns first hand before she makes the decision the rental agent's hesitance is because the cottage is haunted, supposedly by its now deceased former owner, seaman Captain Daniel Gregg. After she moves in, she does meet the spirit of Captain Gregg face-to-face. Because she refuses to be scared away by his presence, the two come to an understanding, including that he will not make his presence known to Anna. As time progresses, the two develop a friendship and a bond. Despite his statements to her that she needs to live her life including finding another husband, Daniel seems not to approve of any of the men that enter her life, including the most serious, children's author Miles Fairley. Because of his feelings for her, Daniel eventually has to decide if being a part of her life is more a benefit or hindrance to her in carrying on with the living, regardless of perhaps not being able to carry out his initial goal of realizing his vision for Gull Cottage if he leaves.

In 1900, a young widow finds her seaside cottage is haunted...and forms a unique relationship with the ghost.


1900: Having had enough of living with her late husband's mother and maiden aunt, young widow Lucy Muir decides to move with her daughter Anna to a place of her own by the sea. Her eye falls on the picturesque coastal village of Whitecliff where she finds a beautiful house Gull Cottage. The landlord tries his hardest to dissuade Lucy from taking the cottage, telling her that all the previous tenants have moved out just as quickly as they moved in. Lucy soon discovers the reason for the landlord's warnings when she sees windows and doors open on their own, candles blown out and hears disembodied laughter. Unlike the previous tenants, strong-willed Lucy refuses to be scared off by the hauntings and demands that the ghost reveal himself. He appears and Lucy recognises him immediately as Captain Daniel Gregg, the cottage's previous owner and whose portrait hangs above the mantelpiece. Initially hostile towards one another, Lucy and the Captain soon develop a mutual respect that quickly becomes admiration. When Lucy suddenly finds herself in financial difficulties, in order to raise money the Captain (or Daniel as he asks her to call him) dictates to her a novel about his life. While writing the book, Daniel and Lucy learn more about each other and become closer. When the book is finally finished and ready to be published, Lucy realises she's fallen in love with Daniel, and he with her. Both know that the situation is hopeless, and Daniel tells her that he wants her to see men. Lucy reluctantly agrees, and while meeting a publisher in London, Lucy meets the smooth-talking Miles Fairlie, an author of children's books. Miles takes a fancy to the attractive widow and begins to court her. Daniel is not at all happy at Lucy's choice and tries to warn her off but Lucy is enchanted by Miles and thinks Daniel is just being jealous. When Lucy declares her intention to marry Miles, Daniel decides to disappear from Lucy's life permanently. While Lucy is asleep, Daniel bids her a touching farewell and tells her that when she wakes up she will remember him only as a dream. Shortly afterwards, Lucy is devastated to learn that Miles is already married and was just stringing her along.
The years pass, and Lucy continues to live at Gull Cottage with no memory of Daniel until one day Anna, who is now grown up and engaged, mentions that as a little girl she used to regularly see the ghost of Captain Gregg. This jogs something in Lucy's memory. For the next thirty years Lucy resides in Gull Cottage, watching and waiting for something but not quite knowing what. One night Lucy tells her maid that she is feeling unwell and falls asleep in her armchair. Daniel appears, takes her hands and tells her that she'll never be tired again. Lucy, young again, takes Daniel's arm and the two ghosts walk out into the night, together at last for all eternity.
