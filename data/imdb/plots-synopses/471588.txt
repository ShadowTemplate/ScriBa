The Web of Shadows concerns the return of the heroic Toa to Metru Nui. There, they find an old enemy has overtaken the great city with the help of Visorak--robotic spiders that can quickly encase anything or anybody in near-indestructible webs. The Toa undergo a bizarre metamorphosis while sealed within strange cocoons, and emerge as clunky-looking machines made up of mismatched parts. Though horrified, they find that they also possess some new powers, which prove essential for their subsequent journey to restore Metru Nui--and themselves. This delightful Bionicle installment is probably easily accessible for any viewer unfamiliar with the series to date.
Following a long journey to the surface of Mata Nui, the Toa Metru return to their home city for the rest of the sleeping Matoran, only to discover that Metru Nui has been overrun by the spider-like Visorak and their rulers, king Sidorak and queen Roodaka. The Toa soon find themselves caught in the web of the Visorak, their bodies flooded with Hordika venom that mutates them into the beastly Toa Hordika. Tensions rise, and Vakama decides that he can no longer lead his fellow Toa; Roodaka has a more appealing role for him.... The other Toa Hordika soon find themselves under the guidance of the Rahaga, who have come to the decrepit city in search of the legendary guardian Keetongu, whom the Rahaga believe holds the key to the restoration of the Toa Metru and the destruction of the Visorak horde. But Roodaka is ruthless, and Vakama has succumbed to the beast inside himself. And the Toa Hordika are headed right into Roodaka's hands, which seek to break the seal on her true king: Makuta.
The Toa Metru return to Metru Nui to rescue the remaining sleeping Matoran, only to find it overrun by the spider-like Visorak horde and its ruthless, sadistic rulers, Sidorak and Roodaka.
