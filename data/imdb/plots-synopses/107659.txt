An LA detective is murdered because she has microfilm with the recipe to make cocaine cookies. A "Lethal Weapon" style cop team tries to find and stop the fiends before they can dope the nation by distributing their wares via the "Wilderness Girls" cookie drive.
In this parody of buddy-cop comedies, General Curtis Mortars and Mr. Jigsaw are lacing Wilderness Girls cookies with cocaine. It's up to Sergeants Jack Colt and Wes Luger, as well as Billy York informant Becker, to put a stop to this.
