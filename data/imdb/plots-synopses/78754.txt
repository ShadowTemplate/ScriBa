Choreographing and picking dancers for his current show whilst editing his feature film about a stand-up comedian is getting to Joe Gideon. Without the chemical substances, he would not have the energy to keep up with his girlfriend, his ex-wife, and his special dancing daughter. They attempt to bring him back from the brink, but it's too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. He chain-smokes, uses drugs, sleeps with his dancers and overworks himself into open-heart surgery. Scenes from his past life start to encroach on the present and he becomes increasingly aware of his mortality.
Director/choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid life of Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), a womanizing, drug-using dancer.


Sorbid, sorted, or sordid details....the journey into death ...that is the movie all that jazz is a perfect ethnography if the journey of a soul kabukee cheesecake of anti-hero heroic endeaver like a daoists muse in a Buddhist vision of the rambling ways roam- of the posses or gangs of mythology in the Ba Xiang this exemplerary rebel is honest .
