Brother Cadfael, a Crusader-turned-Benedictine-monk, is among those who tend to the bodies of an executed garrison. But when he finds one more body than should be there, he winds up in a mystery involving an heiress masquerading as a boy and two knights campaigning for the same maiden.
Brother Cadfael, a former soldier and Crusader, long ago became a monk and now lives at the monastery in Shrewsbury where he tends to the sick and grows various medicinal herbs. Theses are dark times in England with loyalties divided between King Stephen and Empress Maud, both of whom claim the throne of England. After King Stephen's troops take Shrewsbury castle, the monks have 94 bodies to consecrate to ever lasting life. Cadfael takes charge of the process but finds that there are in fact 95 bodies. Cadfael immediately suspects murder and with the help of Hugh Beringer, and a young girl hiding in the monastery in the guise of a boy, King Stephen gives Cadfael four days to investigate what everyone now accepts is a unlawful killing.
Assigned by King Stephen to dispose of 94 hanged rebels, Cadfael discovers the body of a murdered man among the corpses and given just four days to solve the crime.
