The Peanuts gang celebrates Halloween, with Linus hoping that, finally, he will be visited by The Great Pumpkin; while Charlie Brown is invited to a Halloween party.
Charlie Brown is excited to be invited to his first ever party, Violet's Halloween party. Before the party, the Peanuts gang plan to go trick or treating, with Snoopy, who is dressed as the WWI flying ace, taking his Halloween persona to an extreme. The one person who won't be joining them for the trick or treating or the party is Linus, who will be waiting in his local pumpkin patch for the arrival of the Great Pumpkin. Linus believes that the Great Pumpkin rises out of the most sincere pumpkin patch - none more sincere than his own local one - flies into the air, and delivers presents to all the boys and girls around the world. Because of his belief, Linus is the laughing stock among his friends. Sally is torn between going trick or treating for the first time and attending Violet's sure fire fun Halloween party, or following her love Linus and waiting for the Great Pumpkin's arrival with him.
