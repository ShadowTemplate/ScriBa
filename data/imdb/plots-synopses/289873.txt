American football players Brian Piccolo, of Italian descent with the gift of the gab, and Gale Sayers, black and a social cripple, both join the Chicago Bears. They don't get along, but coach's plan to mix races as roomies forces them to do so. When Gale is about to give up with a knee injury, Brian kicks and helps him till he gets back, and they become friends. Just when Brian gets off the bench in a new position, he's diagnosed with embryonal carcinoma, and when that's cured other dangerous cancers: his career is over, and his life a painful struggle for survival at best...
The story of professional football players Gale Sayes and Brian Piccolo, and how their friendship on and off the field was affected when Piccolo contracted a fatal disease.


Sean Maher (TV's "Party of Five") and Mekhi Phifer (TV's "ER") star in this excellent remake of the 1971 Emmy(R) award-winning drama about the friendship between football players Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers.
When Gale Sayers (
Mekhi Phifer
) joins the Chicago Bears in 1965, the running back is befriended by fellow rookie Brian Piccolo (
Sean Maher
), a brash young man whose personality is the exact opposite of stoic Sayers. As their friendship begins, the two compete for starting positions on the team, but Sayers' talent far outshines Piccolo's and he quickly rises to top of the game. When they become roomates, their friendship deepens, and when Sayers injures his knee it is Piccolo who encourages him to get back in shape and back in the game--if only so Piccolo can compete against him on an even playing field. Both men become better ball players because of - and in spite of - each other, and when Piccolo quickly begins his descent into illness, they form a bond that will last forever.
