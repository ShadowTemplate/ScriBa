Kansas kid Jamie Conway got employed in Gotham Magazine by claiming himself "fluent in French" but actually he was a French amateur himself. Jamie was a drug addict himself due to his wife leaving him and go Paris for her fashion show but she did not find him when she came back to New York. Finally Jamie lost his job due to a French message 4 mistakes. Megan was worried about Jamie and comforted Jamie about Amanda's leaving. Conversely, Jamie's friend introduced Vicky to Jamie and finally Vicky replaced Amanda and become Jamie's best female friend. Jamie finally realized that life can be very optimistic, just depends on how you think about your life, and how you wish to decorate your life.
A disillusioned young writer living in New York City turns to drugs and drinking to block out the memories of his dead mother and estranged wife.


One year ago Jamie Conway married Amanda White, who was a famous model, until one day Amanda claimed she need to work in Paris and left Jamie without coming back. Jamie began to go into bars and sedate himself with drugs and alcohol. Jamie originally got a job but because that job required that he be fluent in French (and he lied on his resume about being fluent in French), every piece Jamie wrote was full of mistakes and therefore rejected.
On Monday Jamie was late for work, Clara asked him to do a french piece and request that it must be 100% mistake-free and she needed that French piece on her desk before the end of business-day. He spent the whole day working on the article and turned it in Tuesday, 12.50am.
On Tuesday, Jamie regretted that he called into work and pretended to be sick. When Clara realized he took sick leave, Jamie wish to revise Monday article, but Megan said Clara already asked for a photocopy and a copy was sent by Clara's home for her to check.
On Wednesday, Clara was angry and Jamie was fired.
Alright, speak up to here. You should find the rest of the day yourself. Thank you.
