Addison Terrill (Howell), a Dallas attorney, comes home one night to find his wife brutally murdered with the words "We're even now" scrawled across the bedroom wall. The cops suspect he killed her, and now ADDISON must race through the underside of Dallas to find the only other suspect. His ally is a grudging ex-cop (Esposito) who knows what it takes to deliver justice. If they can overcome their differences, they'll be able to solve the case before anyone else gets hurt.
