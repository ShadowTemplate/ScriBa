When Kajal (Sridevi) marries Raaj (Anil Kapoor), an Engineer by profession, she and her dad (Kader Khan), automatically assume that he is rich, wealthy, and corrupt. But that is not the case. Raaj does not have an air-conditioner, a car, nor even a refrigerator. This infuriates Kajal, and in her mind she creates a separate world, where she is rich, wealthy, has several cars, and lives lavishly in a big bungalow. Even with birth of two children, and several years of marriage, does not change Kajal. When Jahnvi (Urmilla Matondkar) Raaj's boss's (Saeed Jaffrey) daughter comes from overseas into their lives, she falls for the honest Raaj. After meeting the greedy Kajal, Jahnvi offers a large sum of money in exchange of Raaj. And Kajal, seeing this as her opportunity to wealth and a easy life, accepts, not knowing that this decision will change her life forever.
