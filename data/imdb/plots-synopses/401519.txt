While attending an anniversary party at his superior officer's house, Lynley is given the task of investigating the death by car of a woman. He and Havers think it odd that he is given the case, but doggedly pursue the truth. The woman was the mother of a gifted violinist who mysteriously abandoned his concert just at the time his mother was run down. As the plot deepens, connections to a crime 20 years earlier appear and tensions between Lynley and a fellow policeman boil over.
Havers may be investigating her last case - after being reduced in rank to Detective Constable she has submitted her resignation and is working her 28 day notice period. She and DI Lynley investigate the murder of Eugenie Martin who was struck by a car and repeatedly driven over until she was nearly unrecognizable. There are several possible suspects. The man who found her body on the street claims not to have known her, even though she had his name and address on a piece of paper in her car. She was divorced from her husband 20 years ago and was estranged from her son, a brilliant concert violinist. Then there is Katja Wolf who, over twenty years ago, drowned her infant daughter in the bath and was released from prison three weeks before being run over. Most difficult for the detectives is the fact that their superior officer is not telling them everything he knows.
Lynley and Havers (who plans to resign from the force in a month) are assigned to the hit and run (and hit and run again) of a woman.
