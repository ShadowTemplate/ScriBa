At the Belgrade army hospital, casualties of Bosnian civil war are treated. In the hospital they remember their youth and the war. Two young boys, Halil, a Muslim, and Milan, a Serb, have grown up together near a deserted tunnel linking the Yugoslav cities of Belgrade and Zagreb. They never dare go inside, as they believe an ogre resides there. Twelve years later, during the Bosnian civil war, Milan, who is trapped in the tunnel with his troop, and Halil, find themselves on opposing sides, fatefully heading toward confrontation.
While lying wounded in a hospital, a Bosnian Serb named Milan goes through flashbacks of his childhood and different scenes of the war in Bosnia that started in 1992. He and his best friend Halil, a Muslim fighting on the other side, were best friends their whole life and are now fighting on opposite sides. Besides him different characters are shown, and what they did before the war. We are able to see the normal life of a drug addict, a thief or a simple farmer, and how or why they joined the war.
