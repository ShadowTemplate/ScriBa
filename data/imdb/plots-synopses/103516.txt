Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison now deals with a racially charged murder. The long-dead body of a young black woman is discovered in a district recently convulsed by police brutality and which now is in the midst of a highly-charged political campaign. Her investigation is hampered by the hostility of the local populace, and the clumsy methods of some of her subordinates and irresponsible journalists make things worse. Can she solve the case before a race riot breaks out? Her job is complicated when a former lover is assigned to her command as a subordinate.
DCI Jane Tennyson and her team have a murder on their hands when the new owners of a home find human remains in the back garden. Everyone believes the remains to be that of Simone Cameron, a young woman who went missing several years before and whose death for which someone is now serving a prison sentence. The environment is racially charged and the local Afro-Caribbean community believe that the wrong man is in jail and that this now proves it. The case becomes complicated for a number of reasons. DS Robert Oswalde, a former lover, is assigned to her squad unexpectedly. The remains are confirmed not to be those of Simone Cameron but actually those of Joanne Fagunwa, a young woman from Brimingham who had also disappeared around the same time. Tennyson's prime suspect is David Harvey, the man who lived in the house at the time of the killing. She manages to get a deathbed confession from him but is doubtful. At the same time, DS Oswalde arrests Tony Allen, who lived next door to the death house. It all turns to tragedy however with a sudden death. Tennyson's prove correct however when evidence shows that the murderer has yet to be detained.
DCI Jane Tennison's investigation of a murder is complicated with the unexpected participation of her secret lover in her detective unit.
