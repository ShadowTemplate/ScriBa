While taking a week off to move into their new home, Barnaby takes time to visit his aunt, Alice Bly, who is staying at a local convalescent home for a few weeks. She tells him that a resident died there the previous evening and at least one other resident believes it was murder. When the home's administrator tells Barnaby that residents' personal effects are going missing, he gets Troy to look into the goings on at the manor. When a second resident is found dead soon after, Barnaby begins to suspect that something is amiss.
Barnaby pays a visit to his beloved Auntie Alice at the Lawnside nursing home, in which she has taken up temporary residence. The bright and perceptive old lady tells him gossip about the mysterious doings at the place, especially in regards to the death of one of the residents whose Cartier watch has vanished. More deaths follow, which is hardly extraordinary at a nursing home filled with men and women in their 80s. Nevertheless, Barnaby suspects something fishy is going on - but he'll have to ignore the red herrings to find out what it is.
A visit to his convalescent aunt prompts Barnaby to investigate a series of suspicious deaths at the nursing home where she is staying.
