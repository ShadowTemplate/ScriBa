A philosophy teacher restless with the need to do something with his life meets a young woman suspected of driving an artist to his death. He finds the very simple Cecilia irritating but develops a sexual rapport with her. Obsessed with the need to own and tormented by her inability to respond to him, he becomes increasingly violent in a quest he can't name - a quest that slowly begins to undermine his certainties.
Middle-aged Martin confused and irritated from the onset of mid-life crisis, has clung too stubbornly to his belief in platonic love and its incumbent celibacy. He inadvertently meets Cécilia who is rumored to have killed her last lover (a painter) with her voracious sexual appetite. Martin, a philosopher, questions everything he experiences; Cécilia, a seemingly indifferent older adolescent, questions nothing at all. Martin's crisis slowly and agonizingly crescendos, in the face of her confounding simplicity, during their brief and bizarre affair.
