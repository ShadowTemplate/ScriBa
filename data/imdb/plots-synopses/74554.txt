In the early 1950s Howard Prince, who works in a restaurant, helps out a black-listed writer friend by selling a TV station a script under his own name. The money is useful in paying off gambling debts, so he takes on three more such clients. Howard is politically pretty innocent, but involvement with Florence - who quits TV in disgust over things - and friendship with the show's ex-star - now himself blacklisted - make him start to think about what is really going on.
In the 50's, in New York City, the screenplay writer Alfred Miller meets his apolitical friend, the cashier of restaurant and smalltime bookmaker Howard Prince and tells him that he can not work anymore since he is blacklisted. Prince offers to sell his scripts to the producer of a TV station using his own name and Alfred offers a 10% commission to Prince. Prince uses the money to pay his debts and improve his life and soon he offers his name to two other blacklisted writers. Meanwhile he dates the TV screenplay editor Florence Barrett. When the veteran actor Hecky Brown is blacklisted and fired by the producer Phil Sussman, the idealistic Florence quits her job. But when Hecky Brown commits suicide, Prince takes a stand against the unjust system.
Woody Allen plays a man of no real talent or strong political convictions who is paid to be a front for a group of black listed writers during the McCarthy period in the United States (early 1950s). There are comedic elements in his attempts to pass off stories he hasn't read as his own, until he comes under the view of the UnAmerican Activities Subcommittee.
A cashier poses as a writer for blacklisted talents to submit their work through, but the injustice around him pushes him to take a stand.
