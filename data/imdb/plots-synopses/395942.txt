(Cantonese with English subtitles) An advertising executive revamps a defunct martial arts tournament in order to use it in an advertising campaign for his current project. He also enlists the expert help of a young kung fu student who now lives in Japan. Sparks begin to fly between the two, until reality sets in: the ad exec already has a girlfriend, and they have a competition to think about.
