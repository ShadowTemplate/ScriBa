In the 12-years-since comedic sequel to 1993's The Sandlot, a new group of kids have moved into the sandlot: David Durango (Max Lloyd-Jones), Mac McKing (Brett Kelly), Saul (Cole Evan Weiss), his deaf brother Sammy "Fingers" (Sean Berdy), Tarquell (Neilen Benvegnu), Scotty's younger brother Johnnie Smalls (James Willson), and a surprise for The Sandlot 2, a girl in the group Hayley Goodfarier ('Samantha Burton'). When Johnnie mistakenly sends a model rocket over the junk fence in The Great Fear's yard, the gang must retrieve it. Even with the help of The Retriever (Griffin Reilly Evans, the director's son), a kid who steals dog tags and finds The Great Fear's a challenge. Yes, complete with another psychotic name-calling scene with Mac and little league captain Singleton (Reece Thompson). And, of course, with James Earl Jones as Mr. Mertle.
A film about a group of young baseball-enthusiasts who test the terrifying myth of Mr. Mertle owning a freakishly large and dangerous dog in his backyard.
