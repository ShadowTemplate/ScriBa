A family in Chicago inherits the yacht formerly owned by Clark Gable. They decide to sail it from the island of Ste. Pomme de Terre to Miami, and they sail with the assistance of Captain Ron and their lives will never be the same again.


Martin Harvey(Martin Short) inherits a sailboat formerly owned by Clark Gable that could be valuable if delivered in good condition to a yacht broker in Miami. He wants to take his wife(Katherine) and the 2 kids to Ste. Pomme de Terre in the Caribbean and sail it back to Miami with a Captain provided by the broker. He tells his wife it will be a family adventure, she is reluctant until their 16 year old daughter, Caroline, announces she is engaged to a scruffy looking teenager. They hope a little separation will cool down the romance, so off goes the family to `Saint Potato`island to find that the yacht is not been kept in good repair. When the broker hears this he decides to get them a `local` to pilot the boat, enter Captain Ron(Kurt Russel), a long-haired, one-eyed old salt who has been drifting around the Caribbean since his Navy days. Their adventure starts with fixing the boat, learning to sail but Captain Ron leads them into island jungle, getting lost, revolutionaries, a tropical storm, pirates and lands them in Cuba without passports or money. They succeed in making it to Miami and along the way they bond together as a family.
