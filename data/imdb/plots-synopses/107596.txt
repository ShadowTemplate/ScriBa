A man, dissatisfied with his step-sons life choices, decides to leave his manor to Shrewsbury Abbey. When the man ends up poisoned after eating food sent from the abbey, the step-son becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Cadfael doubts the quick assumption, sets out to find the actions and motives behind the crime, and in the process may help to redeem himself for a promise long unfulfilled.
Cadfael has a murder to solve when Gervase Bonel is found dead at the abbey. Bonel had only recently gifted his estate to the monks at Shrewsbury in return for accommodation for himself and his wife for the remainder of his days. It is quickly apparent to Cadfael that Bonel was poisoned and he is certain that the poison used was Monk's Hood, a plant likely taken from his own dispensary. With Hugh Beringar away, Sergeant Warden is in charge and he is certain that the killer is Edwin Gurney, Bonel stepson. The two had been quarreling of late over Bonel's decision to give his property away despite a promise to Gurney's mother that Edwin would inherit. Cadfael believes the young man to be innocent but may have trouble proving his case when Brother Jerome, temporarily in charge with Abbot Radulfus away, forbids him to interfere with the investigation.
When an unpleasant and cruel nobleman spites his stepson by ceding his estate to the abbey, he ends up being poisoned by one of Brother Cadfael's medications.
