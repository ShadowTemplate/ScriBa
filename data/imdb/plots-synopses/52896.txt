Tony Manetta runs an unsuccessful Miami hotel, on which he can't meet the payments. Another liability is his weakness for dames (Shirl, his sexy current flame, is even less responsible than Tony).

Tony and Ally just play along to be diplomatic, but when the woman in question proves to look like Eleanor Parker...
