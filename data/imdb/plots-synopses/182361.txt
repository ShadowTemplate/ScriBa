While enjoying a vacation at an exclusive resort on the Cornish coast, Poirot and Hastings meet beautiful young heiress Magdala Buckley. Known to her friends as Nick, she confides to them that she has recently survived several events that might have taken her life: a heavy-framed picture dropping on her head, a boulder falling off a cliff, and failed brakes. When Poirot notices a bullet hole in her hat, they put her under their protection and discover that her dead fiance, a noted aviator killed in a tragic accident, had named her as heir in his will. In the interim, his wealthy uncle is found to have died, making her the unexpected beneficiary of a great fortune. Poirot realizes this inheritance is the motive for continued attempts on her life, and in his quest for the the truth, he uncovers a tangled web of greed, forgery, drug addiction, fraud, poison, and murder.
While on holiday with Captain Hastings at the posh Majestic hotel on the Cornish coast, Hercule Poirot makes the acquaintance of Magdala 'Nick' Buckley, a young woman who lives nearby in the large but dilapidated estate called End House. She mentions to Poirot that she has had a bad run of luck in the last few days narrowly escaping injury when her car brakes failed and later when a huge boulder nearly fell on her from above. Poirot is soon convinced that the young woman's life is in danger, a fact that is apparently confirmed when another young woman wearing Miss Buckley's wrap is shot. As he delves into the case, he learns of a possible motive in the case - Miss Buckley is the unknowing beneficiary of a large personal fortune. He is puzzled however by one piece of information that simply does not seem to fit.
