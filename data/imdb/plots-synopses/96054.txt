A contemporary comedic look at black college life. Dap (Fishburne) and Big Brother Almighty (Esposito) conflict over the greek frat system while the Wanna-be's and Jigaboo's conflict over self-identity and self-esteem.
A not so popular young man wants to pledge to a popular fraternity at his historically black college.


Vaughn "Dap" Dunlap (Laurence Fishburne) is a politically conscious African American student at Mission College, an all black college in rural Georgia, who leads anti-apartheid demonstrations in encouraging students and school administrators to completely divest from South Africa. At the same time, Dap is also feuding with the Greek fraternal system member and rush chairman, Julian Eaves (Giancarlo Esposito) aka: Dean Big Brother Almighty of Gamma Phi Gamma Fraternity, Incorporated over the frat jocks' indifference to the rest of blacks in America and the rest of the world for their own sports-career minds.
Meanwhile, Dap's younger cousin, Darrell (Spike Lee) aka "Half-Pint", is a fellow activist and a Gamma pledge who soon becomes torn over his far left-wing political views and of the sports of his new frat brothers. The Gamma women's auxiliary, the Gamma Rays, battle with non-Greek fellow co-eds... and Dap's dark-skinned activist friends battle the light-skinned locals and school officals over rights on the campus.
