Defiant's crew is part of a fleet-wide movement to present a petition of grievances to the Admiralty. Violence must be no part of it. The continual sadism of Defiant's first officer makes this difficult, and when the captain is disabled, the chance for violence increases.
During the Napoleonic Wars, Captain Crawford takes command of the HMS Defiant and is ordered to rendezvous with the fleet in Corsica. With his son aboard as a new midshipman, Capt. Crawford takes an even hand with his crew. This does not sit well with his second-in-command Lt. Scott-Paget, a cruel officer who is also well connected and someone who has proven to be the downfall of his previous commanding officers. As a battle of wills ensues, Scott-Paget uses Crawford's son in an attempt to get the Captain to lash out against him. With the men on the verge of mutiny, they must also face the enemy.
