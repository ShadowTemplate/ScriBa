Corren los años 40. Una modesta compañía de cineastas españoles abandona la España de Franco trasladándose a la Alemania de Hitler, para realizar una película coproducida entre ambos países. Se trata de un musical de ritmos andaluces protagonizado por la actriz Macarena Granada y dirigido por Blas Fontiveros. El contraste de ideologías entre españoles y alemanes es bastante marcado, y ello no tarda en hacerse notar...
During the Spanish Civil War, a movie troupe goes from Spain to Berlin for a joint production with UFA. Besides the jealousies and sexual escapades of any movie set, culture and politics add to the tensions: they use Jewish and Gypsy prisoners as extras to give an Andalucian look, the director is sleeping with his ingénue with no intention of leaving his wife, and the ingénue cooperates with this Nazi project in hopes of freeing her father from one of Franco's jails. When Goebbels himself plies her with favors, the director and the rest of the crew encourage her to sleep with him for the good of the production. Does she have any options? Will anyone act unselfishly?
A company of Spanish movie makers leaves Franco's Spain and moves to Hitler's Germany to make a film in co-production. Soon some problems start to arise...
