Prior Herluin arrives in Shrewsbury demanding that Prior Radulhus hand over the reliquary containing the bones of the holy virgin St. Winifred. Pilgrims to Shrewsbury have always been generous to the Abbey because of the Holy relic and its loss may result in an economic downturn for the Benedictines. Hurliun bases his claim on the reported visions of his novice monk Tutilo and the burning of his abbey in the current civil war. When a dying wealthy old woman takes a liking to the handsome Tutilo and doubts his vocation, she bequeaths a priceless jeweled necklace to him. It is soon obvious that the necklace is more than enough to rebuild the abbey, Winifred's bones now seem safe at Shrewsbury, but the theft of the gems and a resultant murder throw the issue in doubt again. Among the red herrings facing Cadfael are a minstrel, his slave - a beautiful singer, an arrogant nobleman, and Tutilo himself.
Ramsey Abbey in Cambridgeshire puts in a claim for the remains of St. Winifred, whose reliquary is the object of prayer and lucrative donations to Shrewsbury Abbey.
