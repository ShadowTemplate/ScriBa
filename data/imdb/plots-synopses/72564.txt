In 1999, Moonbase Alpha, nestled in the Lunar crater Plato, is a scientific research colony and watchdog over silos of atomic waste from Earth stored on the Moon's far side. On September 13, 1999, magnetic energy builds to cause an explosive chain-reaction of the waste, blasting the Moon out of Earth orbit and off the plane of the ecliptic, out of the Solar System. The inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha are unable to return to Earth and must survive on their wandering Moon as it is displaced further into unknown space by freak space warps. Along the way, they are joined by an alien woman with the ability to change herself into any living creature at will.
In the year 1999, the Earth's moon is torn from its orbit when a nuclear explosion occurs on a radioactive dump site, sending moon base Alpha and its crew on a journey through the galaxy.
In 1999, Moonbase Alpha is set up to act not only as a research center, but as an early warning station in case of alien attack. Its commanded by Americans Commander John Koening and Doctor Helena Russell. Also at this time, Earth has decided to ship all of its nuclear waste to the Moon. Unfortunately, on September 13th, just as a deep space probe is to be launched, a chain reaction causes the waste to explode, causing the moon to be ripped from its orbit and sent hurtling out of the solar system. Now, the crew must struggle for survival as they go further and further out in space.
The crew of Moonbase Alpha must struggle to survive when a massive explosion throws the Moon from orbit into deep space.
