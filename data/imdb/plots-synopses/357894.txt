Lulu Wong lives a double life - part urban social butterfly, part vigilante superhero.


This 2004 movie follows a Chinese socialite (Michelle Yeoh) who, in her spare time, fights the forces of evil. She teams up with her childhood buddy, Mr. Rich Man, who is a police officer, to foil a kidnapping ring with more sinister undertones... world domination.
