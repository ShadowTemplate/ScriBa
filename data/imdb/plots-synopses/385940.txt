Laci Peterson is a pregnant mother to-be. On the eve of Christmas, she disappears. Her husband, Scott Peterson, and her whole family search for Laci. There are no signs of Laci anywhere. Months go on and on, and the media and public start to think that Scott murdered his wife. The Rocha family support Scott and defend him, until Scott's mistress, Amber Frey, holds a press conference admitting that she was having an affair with Scott, while he was married. Scott had told Amber that he was not married. This makes the Rocha family start to doubt Scott's innocence. Laci's mother, Sharon Rocha, always believed Scott to be a PERFECT HUSBAND, but now she doubts that. Finally the Rocha family publicly announces that they are against Scott. In 2003, Laci's body and baby wash up on shore, and she is officially declared to be murdered. The police arrest Scott and the movie ends here.
As the police search for a missing pregnant woman, new evidence emerges that throws suspicion on her seemingly devoted husband.
