The master sleuth must deal with the menace of Charles Augustus Milverton, an art dealer who has a profitable sideline as a blackmailer with much of London's high society in his grip. Unfortunately, he is no amateur at his line of work and Holmes must use all his cunning and skill in some risky operations to foil this criminal.
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson attempt to identify and stop a very adept blackmailer who has ruined many families. His identity is unknown however and the detective has only one, cryptic clue written on the fly leaf of a book of poetry. His latest victim is Col. John Dorking who wrote love letters to a male actor. When he refuses to pay the blackmailer, he finds his bride to be, Lottie Miles, the recipient of his letters. The engagement is broken, which results in the Colonel's subsequent suicide. The late Colonel however points Holmes in the direction of Charles Augustus Milverton, who, it seems, is in fact the master blackmailer. Milverton next focuses on a close friend of Lottie Miles, Lady Eva Blackwell, whose indiscreet letters are now in his possession. Holmes acts as an intermediary for Lady Blackwell and sets a trap for the blackmailer. His past actions finally catch up with him however.
Sherlock Holmes confronts the most repugnant adversary of his career in Charles Augustus Milverton, an art dealer by profession but a master blackmailer by occupation who often waits years for the best moment to squeeze London's high society and line his already engorged pockets. As this man generally operates within the law, Sherlock finds reason alone insufficient to bring him down, yet brought down he must be before further reputations, careers and lives of Londoners are ruined. And to that end, Sherlock dates a housemaid.
Holmes and Watson attempt to break the grip of a ruthless blackmailer of their clients.
