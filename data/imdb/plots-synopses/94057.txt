When a liquor store owner finds a case of "Viper" in his cellar, he decides to sell it to the local hobos at one dollar a bottle, unaware of its true properties. The drinks causes its consumers to melt, very messily. Two homeless lads find themselves up against the effects of the toxic brew, as well as going head to head with "Bronson" a Vietnam vet with sociopathic tendencies, and the owner of the junkyard they live in.


A bum called Fred (Mike Lackey) enters at the unkempt shop of an easily-angered man, and he steals some money and a bottle of some alcoholic beverage. Fred runs away through a building which is on fire. He hides himself into safety, but loses the money he's taken in the garbage collector lorry where he was hiding. All this even makes the shop owner realise that there is a hidden compartment at the messy warehouse. It's about some bottles called Viper.
The drink gets distributed, and it seems that it helps solve all kind of problems. Even Fred suggests to drink it to one of his bum friends. Fred is pestered to pay the frent of the derelict abandoned warehouse which he calls home.
Two bums are washing up the windshields of a car, when one of them attacks the driver and kills him. The driver gets smashed into the front mirror and gets killed, while the co-driver screams histerically. The friend who has drunk the Viper thing goes to the toilet, and there, he melts into some blue wallpaint and dies a painful death.
The owner of the junkyard threatens his assistant because she defends the bums and cares for them.
