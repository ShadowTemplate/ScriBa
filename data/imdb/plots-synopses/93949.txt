Unable to prove his innocence; an honest police officer Srivastav hangs himself when he is framed by a criminal JK for a crime he did not committed.

An Indian Batman, if you like, Vijay Srivastav leads a dual life - (seemingly) cowardly and corrupt cop by day and ridiculously costumed vigilante at night. His activities make life miserable for the scheming villains who were incidentally also responsible for his father's death. Generous servings of action, melodrama and cacophonous music culminating in a suitably over-the-top climax.
Inspector Srivastav is framed by a wily and cunning gangster, J.K., and unable to prove his innocence, hangs himself, leaving behind his wife, and son, Vijay. Years later, Vijay has grown up and has joined the police force as an Inspector. Unlike his dad, he is corrupt and does accept bribes to turn a nelson's eye to crime. The City Police are assigned the task of apprehending a customed man called "Shahenshah", who operates at night and targets, tries and kills gangsters in a "Judge and Executioner "style. No one knows the real identity of Shahenshah, as he is feared by the police department, and respected by the poor and middle-class.
