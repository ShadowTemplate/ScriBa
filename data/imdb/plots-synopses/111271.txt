Squanto is a high-born Indian warrior from a tribe on the Atlantic coast of North America which devotes its life to hunting and rivalry with a neighboring tribe. Everything changes forever after a ship arrives from England, prospecting the region's commercial potential for the rich Sir George, who uses all his wealth and influence only for ever greater profit. When it returns, several Indians find themselves captives on board, including Squanto. The arrogant Christians consider themselves utterly superior to the 'heathen savages' and treat them as brutally as they do beasts. Squanto fights a bear in a circus, not understanding how men can be so cruel to that creature either, and manages a spectacular escape, but where must he go? He finds shelter and help in a rural monastery, where it takes his protector some effort to prevent the others considering the unknown as diabolical. In time sir George's men come looking for him most brutally, but he escapes again, now determined to find a way back home, across the ocean...
This film tells the story of Squanto, who has been taken to England against his will from his New England homeland. He escapes his captors, stealing a boat and heading to sea. After his boat wrecks in a storm, he's found by some friars and stays in their monastery until he gets a chance to return home. He finally gets back, only to find his people decimated by a plague and English people living in what was once his home. He's faced with the choice of joining another tribe in their attack on the Pilgrims or trying to make peace between the two sides.
Set in the early 1600's, a New England Indian brave warrior named Squanto is captured and subsequently enslaved by English settlers, but survives a shipwreck and returns to America to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in their strange new land. Driven by a passion to be free, he risks everything to escape his captors, braving the wilderness and triumphing, finally, as a great leader.
