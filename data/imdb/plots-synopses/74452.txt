Oberst Steiner, a German parachute unit commander, is sent to England on a covert mission to kidnap Prime Minister Winston Churchill and bring him to Berlin. The seemingly impossible assignment becomes more and more feasible as the mission grows nearer with Steiner and his men arriving in England to a very real possibility of success.
Colonel Steiner is a German Officer in WW II who has been court-marshaled for opposing the SS in rounding up Jews. He is offered an assignment to go to England and abduct Winston Churchill. His loyal parachute group dress as Polish soldiers and take over a small English town, supposedly on a training maneuver to await the coming visit of the Prime Minister.
Following Mussolini's daring rescue by the SS, Hitler decides Churchill can be abducted and brought to Berlin and orders Wilhelm Canaris chief of Abwerh to make a feasibility study. The feasibility study conceived brilliantly by redoubtable Lt. Col. Radel becomes reality when an Abwehr agent in England reports Churchill's imminent visit to a Bomber Command Unit on the eastern coast...
A German plot to kidnap Winston Churchill unfolds at the height of World War II.
