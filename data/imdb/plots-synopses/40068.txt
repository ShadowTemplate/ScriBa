The world of freight handlers Wilbur Grey and Chick Young is turned upside down when the remains of Frankenstein's monster and Dracula arrive from Europe to be used in a house of horrors. Dracula awakens and escapes with the weakened monster, who he plans to re-energize with a new brain. Larry Talbot (the Wolfman) arrives from London in an attempt to thwart Dracula. Dracula's reluctant aide is the beautiful Dr. Sandra Mornay. Her reluctance is dispatched by Dracula's bite. Dracula and Sandra abduct Wilbur for his brain and recharge the monster in preparation for the operation. Chick and Talbot attempt to find and free Wilbur, but when the full moon rises all hell breaks loose with the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein all running rampant.
Two hapless freight handlers find themselves encountering Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man.


Chick Young [Bud Abbott] and Wilbur Grey [Lou Costello] are working for a package delivery company when they receive two large packages bound for Dr McDougol's House of Horrors. One is a coffin containing the remains of Dr Latos/Dracula [Bela Lugosi]; the other is a box with the dormant Frankenstein monster [Glenn Strange]. Shortly thereafter, Larry Talbot [Lon Chaney, Jr] flies in from London to stop Dracula from awakening the monster.
Poor Wilbur. No one believes him that Dr Latoes is really Dracula and that the monster is alive. Dracula has Wilbur's girlfriend Dr Sandra Mornay [Lenore Auburn] under his power, and Sandra has designs on Wilbur -- not for his body but for his brain. It is the perfect simple brain needed for the monster. Together, Dracula and Sandra capture Wilbur and proceed with the operation. Fortunately, Chick and Talbot arrive in time to save Wilbur. At the end, the wolfman grabs Dracula in his bat form and jumps into a raging river. The monster is consumed by fire, leaving only the Invisible Man sitting in a boat with Wilbur and Chick.
