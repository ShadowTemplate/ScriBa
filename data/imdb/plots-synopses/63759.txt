An artist in crisis is haunted by nightmares from the past in Ingmar Bergman's only horror film, which takes place on a windy island. During "the hour of the wolf" - between midnight and dawn - he tells his wife about his most painful memories.
Johan Borg and his pregnant wife Alma arrive on a remote island to spend the summer. Johan, an artist by profession, is uninspired and restless of late. One day an old woman approaches Alma telling her to read Johan's diary, which he keeps in a black bag under the bed. As Johan's mental state continues to deteriorate, Alma becomes increasingly frightened. Unable to sleep at night for some time now, Johann tells Alma of events from his youth and eventually of Veronica, the woman he lived with for 5 years. Eventually, Johan walks off into the woods, never to be seen again. Even Alma isn't sure what was real and what was imagined.
While vacationing on a remote Scandanavian island with his younger pregnant wife, an artist has a emotional breakdown while confronting his repressed desires.
