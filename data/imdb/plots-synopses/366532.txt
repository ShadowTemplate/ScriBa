St. Marie-La-Mauderne is a tiny fishing village in what some may call the middle of nowhere. For eight years the locals have stood in line for weekly welfare checks, wearing patched sweaters and glum expressions, and remembering the good old days when the catch was good, the fishermen were proud, and life seemed a lot more magical. Then one day, a chance at salvation: a small company wants to build a factory on the island, but only if a full-time doctor lives in St. Marie. The situation seems hopeless until a young doctor in Montreal has an unfortunate incident with a traffic cop and finds himself on a boat to the faraway village. But how to convince handsome, young, urbane Dr. Lewis to stay in this dreary little spot on the map? As it turns out, the answer lies in just a bit of seductive subterfuge--along with a tapped phone, a hastily assembled cricket team, and something called Festival de Beef Stroganoff.
When the fishes finished in the small fishing village of St. Marie-La-Mauderne eight years ago, the pride and joy of the place ended. The unemployed fishermen have financially supported by the government welfare checks for two weeks and have lived with shame for the month. When a company raises the possibility of building a small factory in the village, the dwellers need only a full-time doctor living in the community to make the dream come true. But they do not find any doctor that want to move to St. Marie-La-Mauderne. When the thirty-three years old Montreal's doctor Christopher Lewis (David Boutin) has an incident in a highway, the former Mayor of St. Marie and presently highway patrolman forces him to stay in the village for a month. Meanwhile, the locals under the leadership of Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard) bug his telephone and plot a scheme to convince him to sign a five years contract with the village.
A much-needed boost, in the form of a new factory, is promised to the residents of the tiny fishing village St. Marie-La-Mauderne, provided they can lure a doctor to take up full-time residency on the island. Inspired, the villagers devise a scheme to make Dr. Christopher Lewis a local.
