An Arizona deputy goes to New York City to escort a fugitive back into custody.



There's a disruption in the activities of Sheriff Walt Coogan (Clint Eastwood) as a crack tracker and ladies' man when he is ordered as punishment to travel from his home state Arizona to extradite bail jumper Ringerman (Don Stroud) from jail in New York City. When Coogan arrives he is met by bureaucratic red tape because Ringerman is in the hospital recovering from a bad dose of LSD. Furthermore Coogan can get no cooperation from overworked Police Detective and department supervisor Lt. McElroy (Lee J. Cobb) who tells Coogan to wait for the autocratic machinery to function. Coogan takes matters into his own hands and breaks Ringerman out of the prison hospital but is waylaid by the criminal's associates, one of which is the lovely and elusive Linny Raven (Tisha Sterling) who knocks out the Arizona Sheriff and steals his gun. Lt. McElroy orders Coogan to leave town but the Sheriff has met lovely parole officer Julie (Susan Clark), a na√Øve case worker who is taken by Coogan's charms. Coogan discovers that Linny is one of Julie's patients and manages to track down the young girl which leads him to Ringerman.
