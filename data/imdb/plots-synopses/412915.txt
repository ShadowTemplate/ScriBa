Flynn, an over 30 "professional student," is banned from more classes, since he already has 22 degrees. Unexpectedly hired by a mysterious library, he's soon pursuing a stolen artifact from the library, a pursuit taking him to far-off lands.
Academically brilliant, socially awkward New york intellectual Flynn Carsen successfully postulates for a post as librarian. Only once accepted, he learns it's not really about managing books but mainly hunting relics. His first mission, in three parts, is for a magical Biblical spear, the key to unlimited destructive energy, which is broken into three parts, hidden in different countries, from Amazonia to Shangri La. He finds himself teamed up against a sinister, bloodthirsty serpent brotherhood with a martial arts specialist who failed to protect his predecessor Edward Wilde, or actually worse.
Flynn Carson is a thirty year old professional student with 22 degrees. Call him Uber-nerd. Booted out of his archaeological dig, he's invited to join The Metropolitan Library. He finds that his job requires more than checking books in and out. He's more a hunter for relics--but can't fight his way out of a paper bag. So the Library sends along a beautiful martial arts expert, Nichole (Sonya Walter) to protect him. The Library seeks a three part artifact, the Spear of Destiny. But so do the nefarious Serpent Brotherhood! Three countries later, trouble continues. But so does fun!
When a magical artifact is lifted from his library, a meek librarian sets out to ensure its safe return. To do so, however, he enlists the service of a woman with exceptional martial arts skills - who becomes the enforcer in the relationship.
