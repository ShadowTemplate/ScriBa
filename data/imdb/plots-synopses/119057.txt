When the young actress Raquel flirts with Gigi, Linda feels that she must change her behavior to keep her relationship with her lover. Eva is a widow literature professor with a son. Eva feels desire for Luis but lives a moral dilemma between her lust and their age difference. Barbara is hypochondriac and misses her husband Edgar (Didier Flamand), but they have a good relationship and Barbara, her daughter Inês (Marie Guillard) and Luis frequently meets Edgar. When Barbara faints in a store, she discovers that she has an incurable disease.
