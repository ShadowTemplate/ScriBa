In the distant future vampires have come out of the shadows and tried to live among people as a special and peaceful breed. When a series of murders happens, a cop and his vampire colleague are assigned to arrest a dark figure who tears the throat of the victims and strains their blood off.


The Breed is an interesting take on Vampires as being genetic mutations that are able to transform 80% of the humans (20% being immune). The setting is some form of alt. universe in the near future where Nazi Germany happened, but apparently Socialism/Communism is now the form of Government.
The Vampires have contacted the government and desire to establish normal relations as a different race, Jews, Blacks, Indians are mentioned here and the mistreatment by others as a fear. Both sides, humans and vampires, have plans which are going at the same time to wipe out the other.
Sounds more interesting than it actually is! Not too much blood shed for a vampire flick along with some toplessness. Overall, this movie is a real DOG!!
