A dispute between Church and State over Fair fees leads to a brawl and the murder of a prominent visiting merchant, supposedly by a townsman. As more bodies are found, Cadfael starts to think the Church/State difference isn't the cause after all.


Cadfael (Sir Derek Jacobi) must investigate the murders of two visiting merchants who upset the St. Peter's Fair festivities in Shrewsbury. Local tradesmen have plenty of motive for murder, but Cadfael suspects something more than just greed and jealousy at play. When the true cause of the violence is exposed, Cadfael finds himself at the wrong end of an old friend's sword. (from DVD jacket)
