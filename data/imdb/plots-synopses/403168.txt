Barbara Havers is re-appointed to her rank of Detective Sergeant and she and Inspector Lynley are assigned to investigate the murder of Morag McNicholl. The killing was made to look like a suicide but it is clear she was killed by a blow to the head and that her wrists were slit after her death. The police also find a large amount of cash in the flat so they can rule out robbery as a motive. The police pursue several lines of inquiry. The dead woman was membership secretary at a prestigious private club so Havers goes undercover there to see what information she can glean. Lynley looks into identifying a young man who was apparently stalking Morag. Throughout, Lynley is having difficulty coming to grips with his impending fatherhood, fearing that his own dysfunctional family background will get in the way.
Havers is reinstated as Dc and immediately volunteers to go undercover in a case involving a murder made to look like suicide.
