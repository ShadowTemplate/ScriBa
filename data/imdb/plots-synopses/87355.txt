The human history of the Grand Canyon is explored in this documentary, focusing on the earliest native civilizations about which little is known, through the coming of the Europeans, the scientific expedition of John Wesley Powell which mapped the canyon and boated the Colorado River rapids, into modern times. Both aerial and river-level photography is used to propel the viewer into the experience of the canyon.
