Inspector Lynley (Nathaniel Parker) and Sergeant Havers (Sharon Small) are sent to a remote Scottish mansion house, the home of Sir Stuart Stinhurst (Ronald Pickup), to investigate the violent death of a famous playwright whilst she was helping to rehearse a production of her new play. Initial investigation reveals that practically anybody could have committed the crime but everybody appears to have a convincing alibi and nobody has a motive. As the investigation continues an apparent nearby suicide begins to have a bearing on the case and Lynley believes that is wasn't suicide. The arrival of a new guest, Helen Clyde (Lesley Vickerage), a former girlfriend of Lynley's who is now a lover of one of the main suspects starts to cloud his judgement and raise Havers' suspicions. As the real motives begin to appear and the dark pasts of some of the guests are revealed will Lynley catch the double murderer?
DI Lynley and DS Havers find themselves in Scotland to investigate the murder of a well-know playwright. She was staying at the home of Sir Stuart Stinhurst, the play's producer along with the director, actors and agents. To Lynley's great surprise Helen Clyde, his love from university days, is also a guest. Lynley pushes on despite the fact that he obviously still has feelings for Helen and his somewhat prickly relationship with Havers isn't helped by her recommendation that he withdraw from the case. Many had a motive for disposing of the dead woman, but the solution actually lies in a death that occurred some years ago.
After a playwright changes dialogue in her play just days before its opening, she is found brutally stabbed with other murders to follow.
