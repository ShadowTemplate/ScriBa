DI Lynley investigates the death of Nicola Maiden and Gerry Cole who were beaten to death while out camping. Nicola's father Andy Maiden is a retired police officer but neither of her parents know, or will admit to knowing, who Cole is and thought she was seeing Julian Britton.

She had recently quit and set off on her own. Andy had also put him away once, for 10 years, leading to the break-up of Reeve's marriage. When another murder occurs, it sends the investigation in a different direction involving a theft and blackmail. Sgt.

Lynley manages to get her assigned to the case and hopes she will take the opportunity to rehabilitate her reputation and her career.
