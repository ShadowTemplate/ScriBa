Jerry Stanton's pride and joy is successfully coaching the Hurricanes, one of the six competing school soccer teams, sponsored by his employer's sports equipment shop. When the competition goes co-ed, he panics, but relies on Samantha 'Sam', the tomcat among his twin daughters, as not-disastrous girl in his team. Alas, partially due to wife Denise, a psychologist, the team-picking goes pear-shaped, the Hurricanes get stuck with fashionista twin Emma. So he eagerly accepts when the sisters spontaneously suggests secretively trading places, but Denise and attractive boys compromise keeping the charade up.
Twin sisters Emma and Sam come up with a scheme to switch places so each can play in the soccer team they prefer.
