Motor mechanic Dan Brady lacks funds for a heavy date with new waitress Vera, the type whose life's ambition is a fur coat; so he embezzles twenty dollars from his employer. To make up the shortage, he goes in debt for a hundred. Thereafter, every means he tries to get out of trouble only gets him deeper into crime, while everyone he meets is out for what they can get.
The auto mechanic Dan Brady "borrows" twenty dollars from the cash register of the garage where he works to date the blonde waitress Vera Novak in the weekend. His intention is return the money Monday night, when a friend that owes him the same amount will pay him. However, on Monday morning the accountant finds the negative balance, and Dan tries to cover the embezzlement, falling deeper and deeper in a criminal life.
After borrowing $20 from his employer's cash register, an auto mechanic is plunged into a series of increasingly disastrous circumstances which rapidly spiral out of his control.
