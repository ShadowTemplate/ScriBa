Ben Archer is not happy. His mother, Sandy, has just met a man, and it looks like things are pretty serious. Driven by a fear of abandonment, Ben tries anything and everything to ruin the "love bubble" which surrounds his mom. However, after Ben and Jack's experiences in the Indian Guides, the two become much closer.
When Ben Archer's parents divorce, it's just him and his mom. But a few years later, she meets a guy named Jack, it isn't long that he moves in with them and makes changes that Ben doesn't like. Ben, upon advice of some other boys, gets Jack to join the Indian guides with him, hoping that the experience will make him leave. At first Jack is about to pack it in but another parent in the guides tells him that Ben is afraid of losing his mom so Jack sticks it out. But unfortunately Jack, a prosecutor has someone gunning for him.
