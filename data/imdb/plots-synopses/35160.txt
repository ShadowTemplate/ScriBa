Gino, a young and handsome tramp, stops in a small roadside inn run by Giovanna. She is unsatisfied with her older husband Bragana : she only married him for money. Gino and Giovanna fall in love. But Bragana is inhibiting for their passion, and Giovanna refuses to run away with Gino.
"Ossessione", made in 1942 and banned in Italy by Mussolini, is a powerful delineation of the ill-fated love between Gino, a virile young drifter who arrives by chance at a roadside restaurant and filling station, and Giovanna, the beautiful young wife of the fat old man who owns the place. Giovanna's husband disgusts her; every time he touches her she wants to scream. Gino leaves, only to return because he can't get her out of his blood. They kill her husband, but his death haunts the guilt-ridden Gino.
Gino, a drifter, begins an affair with inn-owner Giovanna as they plan to get rid of her older husband.
