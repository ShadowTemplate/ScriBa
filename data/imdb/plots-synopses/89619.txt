This is the pilot episode of the "Moonlighting" (1985) television series. Madeline 'Maddie' Hayes, a wealthy former model, discovers one morning that her business manager has stolen all the money she has in the bank. However, it turns out that she still owns some non-liquid assets -- money-losing companies which were maintained as tax write-offs -- one of which is a detective agency run by David Addison. Maddie meets with him to inform him that the company is to be shut down, but he tries to persuade her to keep it open by convincing her that the detective agency can make money. To prove it, David brings Maddie into a murder case involving a mysterious wristwatch and four million dollars worth of smuggled diamonds.
Maddie Hayes wakes up to find her staff have quit and all her money has been stolen. One of her few remaining assets is a loss-making investigation agency run by David Addison. She sacks the staff but David is determined to keep it going.
