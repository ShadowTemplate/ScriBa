The final film, and the final confrontation between Ogami and Retsudo. With most of his family already dead at Ogami's hands, Retsudo launches one last plot to destroy him, and when that fails, unleashes the fury of every remaining member of the Yagyu Clan.
In the sixth and final film of the Lone Wolf and Cub series, the final conflict between Ogami Itto and the Yagyu clan is carried out.


In this sixth 'Lone Wolf and Cub movie, the swordsman-for-hire Ogami Itto is confronted by a secretive branch of the Yagyu clan that practices black magic, including the ability to burrow through the earth. He encounters Kaori, a female expert with knives.
And there's Hyouei, an illegitimate son of Yagyu Retsudo who kills anyone Itto and Daigoro come into contact with.
It culminates in a final battle between Itto and the combined clan groups under Retsudo on a snow-capped mountain in northern Japan, in which the baby cart becomes a sled. Itto defeats the entire army, shooting, stabbing, slashing, dismembering, and beheading the entire army. But the one-eyed Retsudo again gets away, vowing to kill Itto another time
