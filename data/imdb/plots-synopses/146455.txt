Five years after the events of the Babylon 5 series, a technomage named Galen predicts an imminent attack by the Drakh, the old allies of the Shadows. Through dreams, a thief, a captain, and a president are brought together to head them off. The president is John Sheridan. Because of his irrational behavior, Sheridan's friends begin to wonder about his sanity. It's up to all of them and two prototype battlecruisers, the Excalibur and the Victory, to stop the fleet and their planet-killer. But is there more to the Drakh's plan?
The Alliance has been in existence for five years. In that time, Sheridan has dealt with a few, but highly intense, conflicts. But there is nothing to compare with the legacy of the war with the Shadows. When the Shadows were defeated by the Alliance, they left for the Rim without the Drakh, a worker race used to build and use Shadow technology and weapons. But now, the Drakh have decided that they should be the Master race and with the technology that they got from the Shadows, they plan to destroy the Alliance completely - one Planet at a time. But the Alliance has one hope and that hope lies in four people, from three different races, who are drawn together by their dreams of the coming conflict.
Allies of the Shadows seek revenge against humanity. This movie sets up the series, "Crusade," the sequel to "Babylon 5."
