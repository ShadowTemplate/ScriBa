Lucky (Anil Kapoor) had had enough of change. From orphanages to juvenile delinquent homes! From odd jobs to petty crimes! From home addresses to jail addresses! He wanted his innocence back. A plot of land in Bangalore; a family... a dog; a new beginning. One last con-job, girlfriend in tow, sunset in background, and he would be well on his way. Twenty-four hours later, he's been betrayed by his girlfriend, hunted by a drug lord, orphaned by the death of his three partners and sent to Goa to do a drug deal to buy his life back.
A small-time criminal, betrayed by his girlfriend and owing money to a fearsome crime lord, agrees to travel to Goa for a drug deal and becomes involved with a local woman and her much older husband, both of who want to kill each other.
