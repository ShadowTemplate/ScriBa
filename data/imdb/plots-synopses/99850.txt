Keen young Raymond Avila joins the Internal Affairs Department of the Los Angeles police. He and partner Amy Wallace are soon looking closely at the activities of cop Dennis Peck whose financial holdings start to suggest something shady. Indeed Peck is involved in any number of dubious or downright criminal activities. He is also devious, a womaniser, and a clever manipulator, and he starts to turn his attention on Avila.


Ambitious LA cop with Latin temper moves to Internal Affairs department where he's paired up with lesbian superior. Immediately involved in police brutality case, his pursuit of the young police officer leads him to cross swords with an amoral, possibly sociopathic police sergeant who controls a seemingly department wide network of corruption. Physical and pychological battle between them involving violence, murder and some, occasionally rough, sex ends in triumph for the good guys as usual but with some thought provoking character exploration along the way as the film develops. Sympathethic treatment of the gay female IA officer ahead of its time.
