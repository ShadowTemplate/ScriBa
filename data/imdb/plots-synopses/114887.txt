A Walk in the Clouds depicted a story about a young-married US military soldier, named Paul, who returned home after the World War II. In the middle of the way back home, he accidentally met a girl named Victoria who finished her master's degree. She has not married yet but got pregnant by accident. During the journey they talked a lot. Due to her pregnancy, Victoria was afraid of her father who respected old Mexican tradition. Thus, Paul proposed to pose as her husband to help her face her dad. Paul was not intended to cheat on his wife by pretending to be Victoria's husband. However, when Paul decided to come back to his home and left Victoria, he found his wife cheating on him. Paul then headed back to Victoria's house "Las Nubes" and confessed his true love to Victoria.
After returning from the war, Paul and a young woman meet on a bus as she's headed home from college to help with the grape harvest and face her Old World domineering dad. The woman has not married but is pregnant and she thinks her father is going to kill her. Paul proposes to pose as her husband to help her face her father. When their passion for each other is finally ignited and explodes, they realize they must overcome all odds to be together.

After Paul returned from the World War 2, he meets with Victoria, who is on the way home to the grape field called Las Nubes, which stands for "the clouds." Through the celebration of the harvest, they finds out their love has grown passionately.
