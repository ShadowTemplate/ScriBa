Joyce Barnaby discovers one of her fellow outdoor art class students, Ruth Fairfax murdered and husband Tom, assisted by DS Troy, has yet another case to solve. Fairfax presented herself as an elderly resident and she always insisted on sitting in exactly the same spot in the village green. Imagine the investigators surprise when the autopsy actually reveals her to be a thirty-something woman who disguised herself with wigs and make-up. The case take a peculiar twist when Barnaby is ordered off the case and replaced by a senior officer from the National Intelligence Team. This is especially so when the senior investigating officer is never present and the case is seemingly left in the hands of a DS and a DC who appear less than competent.
Barnaby's wife finds a body on the Midsomer Florey village green while taking part in a watercolor painting class.
