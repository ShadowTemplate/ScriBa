A hot young phone sex addict and his narcissistic opera diva mom. A dangerously agitated hustler and a half-dozen dangerously agitated hustlers who look just like him. A tittering neurotic who thinks she's Vanessa Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave herself. Pot brownies, puke jokes, a gay dad, a flying lesbian, Jerry Hall, a dead body and a fetish for Brian DePalma movies! Anchoring the mayhem is Elisabeth Beaumont, an American opera star visiting Paris to perform "Turandot" and dabble in some belated mothering of her 23 year-old son Thomas. Thomas doesn't need mothering; he needs some good hot manhandling. And, in the best DePalma tradition, the quest for sex leads to voyeurism and voyeurism, leads to murder. From there, it's just a short path to therapy. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist that Thomas visits is a little on the dead side herself, and a nutty patient has taken her place.
Put together a handsome 23-year-old with a penchant for personal ads, his opera-diva mother, her impeccably coutured director and friend, an enigmatically odd actress, plus a few rent boys. Add a good dose of narcissism, a little murder and a lost father.
