In unconventional, high-pressure situations, unpredictable things come up. Mikey and Jay, friends since childhood, are robbing a flat when the owner surprises them: Mikey shoots him dead. The dead man's wife comes home, so the men hide in the bedroom closet with the body. As she relaxes on the bed just a few feet away, makes a phone call, and then entertains a lover, Mikey and Jay find that - in the close quarters of the closet with a corpse propped between them - long-buried feelings come to the fore. Can they ignore what's come up? Will they get out of the closet?
