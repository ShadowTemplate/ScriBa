Teenaged Jessie isn't like the rest of her highly religious family. While her sister is devoted to long distance running and her parents to their conservative Baptist church, Jessie is a bit too eager, a little bit adrift as she drives the dark night streets delivering newspapers. When Jessie finds herself pregnant without any memory of sex and determines that she is carrying the child of God, she disrupts the accepted roles and unquestioned order within her family and her entire small town. Rich with strange apparitions and mysterious women, but also with heartbreakingly simple human interactions, Deborah Kampmeier's magical and profound first feature explores the meaning of love, family, divinity, and the imagination.
