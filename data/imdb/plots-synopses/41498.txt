Captain Henri Rochard is a French officer assigned to work with Lieut. Catherine Gates. Through a wacky series of misadventures, they fall in love and marry. When the war ends, Capt. Rochard tries to return to America with the other female war brides. Zany gender-confusing antics follow.
Captain Henri Rochard of the French army, and Lieutenant Catherine Gates, of the American, are assigned a mission together to stop a German high-level scientist in postwar Germany. They start out thinking they hate each other, but end up falling in love. They encounter various bureaucratic hassles trying to get married. When Catherine's army unit gets recalled back to the USA, the only way they have to stay together is by invoking a law allowing the spouse of American army personnel to enter the country -- the War Bride's act.
